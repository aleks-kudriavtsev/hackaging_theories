    "title": "Role of Nutritional Elements in Skin Homeostasis: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Skin aging is the most prominent phenotype of human aging and is the result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Improving skin aging is essential for maintaining the normal physiological function of the skin and the mental health of the human body. Existing studies have proposed many theories of aging, such as the free radical theory, mitochondrial theory of aging, etc., and accordingly have also proposed appropriate interventions. It is worth noting that many nutrients contained in the skin itself play an important role in maintaining skin health. During the aging process, a decrease in the levels of these nutrients is closely related to a weakening of the related functions. Therefore, supplementing these nutrients offers potential therapeutic options for improving skin aging. In this review, we summarize the important roles of nutrients in the skin and their potential in anti-aging, with the expectation of providing a therapeutic basis and clinical reference for delaying skin aging.",

    "title": "The cell origin of reactive oxygen species and its implication for evolutionary trade-offs.",
    "abstract": "The allocation of resources in animals is shaped by adaptive trade-offs aimed at maximizing fitness. At the heart of these trade-offs, lies metabolism and the conversion of food resources into energy, a process mostly occurring in mitochondria. Yet, the conversion of nutrients to utilizable energy molecules (adenosine triphosphate) inevitably leads to the by-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may cause damage to important biomolecules such as proteins or lipids. The 'ROS theory of ageing' has thus proposed that the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate may be mediated by ROS production. However, the relationship is not as straightforward as it may seem: not only are mitochondrial ROS crucial for various cellular functions, but mitochondria are also actually equipped with antioxidant systems, and many extra-mitochondrial sources also produce ROS. In this review, we discuss how viewing the mitochondrion as a regulator of cellular oxidative homeostasis, not merely a ROS producer, may provide new insights into the role of oxidative stress in the reproduction-survival trade-off. We suggest several avenues to test how mitochondrial oxidative buffering capacity might complement current bioenergetic and evolutionary studies.",

    "title": "Hemispheric organization of the brain and its prevailing impact on the neuropsychology of aging.",
    "abstract": "Age differences in brain hemispheric asymmetry have figured prominently in the neuropsychology of aging. Here, a broad overview of these empirical and theoretical approaches is provided that dates back to the 1970s and continues to the present day. Methodological advances often brought new evidence to bear on older ideas and promoted the development of new ones. The deficit-focused hypothesis of accelerated right-hemisphere aging is reviewed first, followed by subsequent accounts pertaining to compensation, reserve, and their potential hemispheric underpinnings. Structural and functional neuroimaging reveal important and consistent age-related patterns, including indications of reduced brain asymmetry in older relative to younger adults. While not mutually exclusive, different neuropsychologic theories of aging offer divergent interpretations of such patterns, including age-related reductions in neural specificity (dedifferentiation) and age-related compensatory bilateral recruitment [e.g., Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD); Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH)]. Further, recent neurobehavioral evidence suggests that the right hemisphere plays a unique role in resisting the neurocognitive effects of aging via brain reserve. Future advances in human cognitive neuroscience, including neurostimulation methods for targeted interventions, along with analytic techniques informed by machine learning promise new insights into the neuropsychology of aging and the role of hemispheric processes in resilience and decline.",

    "title": "Opportunities and challenges of foodborne polyphenols applied to anti-aging health foods.",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: With the increasing proportion of the global aging population, aging mechanisms and anti-aging strategies become hot topics. Nonetheless, the safety of non-natural anti-aging active molecule and the changes in physiological function that occur during aging have not been clarified. There is therefore a need to develop safer pharmaceutical interventions for anti-aging. Numerous types of research have shown that food-derived biomolecules are of great interest due to their unique contribution to anti-aging safety issues and the prevention of degenerative diseases. Among these, polyphenolic organic compounds are widely used in anti-aging research for their ability to mitigate the physiological functional changes that occur during aging. The mechanisms include the free radical theory, immune aging theory, cellular autophagy theory, epigenetic modification theory, gut microbial effects on aging theory, telomere shortening theory, etc. This review elucidates the mechanisms underlying the anti-aging effects of polyphenols found in food-derived bioactive molecules, while also addressing the challenges associated with anti-aging pharmaceuticals. The review concludes by offering insights into the current landscape of anti-aging active molecule research, aiming to serve as a valuable resource for further scholarly inquiry.",

    "title": "Epigenetic clocks and programmatic aging.",
    "abstract": "The last decade has seen remarkable progress in the characterization of methylation clocks that can serve as indicators of biological age in humans and many other mammalian species. While the biological processes of aging that underlie these clocks have remained unclear, several clues have pointed to a link to developmental mechanisms. These include the presence in the vicinity of clock CpG sites of genes that specify development, including those of the Hox (homeobox) and polycomb classes. Here we discuss how recent advances in programmatic theories of aging provide a framework within which methylation clocks can be understood as part of a developmental process of aging. This includes how such clocks evolve, how developmental mechanisms cause aging, and how they give rise to late-life disease. The combination of ideas from evolutionary biology, biogerontology and developmental biology open a path to a new discipline, that of developmental gerontology (devo-gero). Drawing on the properties of methylation clocks, we offer several new hypotheses that exemplify devo-gero thinking. We suggest that polycomb controls a trade-off between earlier developmental fidelity and later developmental plasticity. We also propose the existence of an evolutionarily-conserved developmental sequence spanning ontogenesis, adult development and aging, that both constrains and determines the evolution of aging.",

    "abstract": "The aging process has been one of the most necessary research fields in the current century, and knowing different theories of aging and the role of different genetic, epigenetic, molecular, and environmental modulating factors in increasing the knowledge of aging mechanisms and developing appropriate diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive ways would be helpful. One of the most conserved signs of aging is epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, noncoding RNAs, and extracellular RNAs. Numerous biological processes and hallmarks are vital in aging development, but epigenomic alterations are especially notable because of their importance in gene regulation and cellular identity. The mounting evidence points to a possible interaction between age-related epigenomic alterations and other aging hallmarks, like genome instability. To extend a healthy lifespan and possibly reverse some facets of aging and aging-related diseases, it will be crucial to comprehend global and locus-specific epigenomic modifications and recognize corresponding regulators of health and longevity. In the current study, we will aim to discuss the role of epigenomic mechanisms in aging and the most recent developments in epigenetic diagnostic biomarkers, which have the potential to focus efforts on reversing the destructive signs of aging and extending the lifespan.",

    "title": "Exploring Patterns of Human Mortality and Aging: A Reliability Theory Viewpoint.",
    "abstract": "The most important manifestation of aging is an increased risk of death with advancing age, a mortality pattern characterized by empirical regularities known as mortality laws. We highlight three significant ones: the Gompertz law, compensation effect of mortality (CEM), and late-life mortality deceleration and describe new developments in this area. It is predicted that CEM should result in declining relative variability of mortality at older ages. The quiescent phase hypothesis of negligible actuarial aging at younger adult ages is tested and refuted by analyzing mortality of the most recent birth cohorts. To comprehend the aging mechanisms, it is crucial to explain the observed empirical mortality patterns. As an illustrative example of data-directed modeling and the insights it provides, we briefly describe two different reliability models applied to human mortality patterns. The explanation of aging using a reliability theory approach aligns with evolutionary theories of aging, including idea of chronic phenoptosis. This alignment stems from their focus on elucidating the process of organismal deterioration itself, rather than addressing the reasons why organisms are not designed for perpetual existence. This article is a part of a special issue of the journal that commemorates the legacy of the eminent Russian scientist Vladimir Petrovich Skulachev (1935-2023) and his bold ideas about evolution of biological aging and phenoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Time always leaves its mark, and our genome is no exception. Mutations in the genome of somatic cells were first hypothesized to be the cause of aging in the 1950s, shortly after the molecular structure of DNA had been described. Somatic mutation theories of aging are based on the fact that mutations in DNA as the ultimate template for all cellular functions are irreversible. However, it took until the 1990s to develop the methods to test if DNA mutations accumulate with age in different organs and tissues and estimate the severity of the problem. By now, numerous studies have documented the accumulation of somatic mutations with age in normal cells and tissues of mice, humans, and other animals, showing clock-like mutational signatures that provide information on the underlying causes of the mutations. In this review, we will first briefly discuss the recent advances in next-generation sequencing that now allow quantitative analysis of somatic mutations. Second, we will provide evidence that the mutation rate differs between cell types, with a focus on differences between germline and somatic mutation rate. Third, we will discuss somatic mutational signatures as measures of aging, environmental exposure, and activities of DNA repair processes. Fourth, we will explain the concept of clonally amplified somatic mutations, with a focus on clonal hematopoiesis. Fifth, we will briefly discuss somatic mutations in the transcriptome and in our other genome, i.e., the genome of mitochondria. We will end with a brief discussion of a possible causal contribution of somatic mutations to the aging process.",

Moreover, MI/RI promotes damage to an aging heart. Notably, 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates cellular energy metabolism, stress response, and protein metabolism, participates in aging-related signaling pathways, and plays an essential role in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury diseases. This study aims to introduce the aging theory, summarize the interaction between aging and MI/RI, and describe the crosstalk of AMPK in aging and MI/RI. We show how AMPK can offer protective effects against age-related stressors, lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking, and hypertension. We also review some of the clinical prospects for the development of interventions that harness the effect of AMPK to treat MI/RI and other age-related cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Understanding why we age is a long-standing question, and many mechanistic theories of aging have been proposed. Owing to limitations in studying the aging process, including a lack of adequate quantitative measurements, its mechanistic basis remains a subject of debate. Here, I explore theories of aging from the perspective of causal relationships. Many aging-related changes have been observed and touted as drivers of aging, including molecular changes in the genome, telomeres, mitochondria, epigenome and proteins and cellular changes affecting stem cells, the immune system and senescent cell buildup. Determining which changes are drivers and not passengers of aging remains a challenge, however, and I discuss how animal models and human genetic studies have been used empirically to infer causality. Overall, our understanding of the drivers of human aging is still inadequate; yet with a global aging population, elucidating the causes of aging has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "People with ovaries experience reproductive aging as their reproductive function and system declines. This has significant implications for both fertility and long-term health, with people experiencing an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders after menopause. Reproductive aging can be assessed through markers of ovarian reserve, response to fertility treatment or molecular biomarkers, including DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation with age associate with poorer reproductive outcomes, and epigenome-wide studies can provide insight into genes and pathways involved. DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks can quantify biological age in reproductive tissues and systemically. This review provides an overview of hallmarks and theories of aging in the context of the reproductive system, and then focuses on studies of DNA methylation in reproductive tissues.\n\nPeople with ovaries experience a natural decline in the function of their reproductive system as they age. This decline eventually leads to menopause, and after menopause, people have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular or other chronic diseases. In the clinic, it is hard to measure aging of the reproductive system, so other markers of the ovary's function, like the number of remaining eggs, are used. We can also measure reproductive aging using molecular biomarkers, which can help us determine when a person's molecular age is different from their chronological age. This review focuses on an overview of biological processes and theories associated with aging, and then focuses on what can be learned from molecular biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Relationships of growth, metabolism, reproduction, and body size to the biological process of aging and longevity have been studied for decades and various unifying \"theories of aging\" have been proposed to account for the observed associations. In general, fast development, early sexual maturation leading to early reproductive effort, as well as production of many offspring, have been linked to shorter lifespans. The relationship of adult body size to longevity includes a remarkable contrast between the positive correlation in comparisons between different species and the negative correlation seen in comparisons of individuals within the same species. We now propose that longevity and presumably also the rate of aging are related to the \"pace-of-life.\" A slow pace-of-life including slow growth, late sexual maturation, and a small number of offspring, predicts slow aging and long life. The fast pace of life (rapid growth, early sexual maturation, and major reproductive effort) is associated with faster aging and shorter life, presumably due to underlying trade-offs. The proposed relationships between the pace-of-life and longevity apply to both inter- and intra-species comparisons as well as to dietary, genetic, and pharmacological interventions that extend life and to evidence for early life programming of the trajectory of aging. Although available evidence suggests the causality of at least some of these associations, much further work will be needed to verify this interpretation and to identify mechanisms that are responsible.",

Pairing motivational theories of aging with longitudinal evidence in personality science provides an explanation for empirical patterns of personality trait development and raises interesting possibilities to promote healthy aging.",

Currently, different theories are on offer in response to these biological traits and to explain the enormous range of longevities observed in the animal kingdom. These theories may be grouped into those that defend non-programmed aging (non-PA) and those that propose the existence of programmed aging (PA). In the present article we examine many observational and experimental data from both the field and from the laboratory and sound reasoning accumulated in recent decades both compatible and not with PA and non-PA evolutionary theories of aging. These analyses are briefly summarized and discussed. Our conclusion is that most of the data favour programmed aging with a possible contribution of non-PA antagonist pleiotropy in various cases.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are an important part of eukaryotic genomes. The role of somatic transposition in aging, carcinogenesis, and other age-related diseases has been determined. This review discusses the fundamental properties of TEs and their complex interactions with cellular processes, which are crucial for understanding the diverse effects of their activity on the genetics and epigenetics of the organism. The interactions of TEs with recombination, replication, repair, and chromosomal regulation; the ability of TEs to maintain a balance between their own activity and repression, the involvement of TEs in the creation of new or alternative genes, the expression of coding/non-coding RNA, and the role in DNA damage and modification of regulatory networks are reviewed. The contribution of the derepressed TEs to age-dependent effects in individual cells/tissues in different organisms was assessed. Conflicting information about TE activity under stress as well as theories of aging mechanisms related to TEs is discussed. On the one hand, transposition activity in response to stressors can lead to organisms acquiring adaptive innovations of great importance for evolution at the population level. On the other hand, the TE expression can cause decreased longevity and stress tolerance at the individual level. The specific features of TE effects on aging processes in germline and soma and the ways of their regulation in cells are highlighted. Recent results considering somatic mutations in normal human and animal tissues are indicated, with the emphasis on their possible functional consequences. In the context of aging, the correlation between somatic TE activation and age-related changes in the number of proteins required for heterochromatin maintenance and longevity regulation was analyzed. One of the original features of this review is a discussion of not only effects based on the TEs insertions and the associated consequences for the germline cell dynamics and somatic genome, but also the differences between transposon- and retrotransposon-mediated structural genome changes and possible phenotypic characteristics associated with aging and various age-related pathologies. Based on the analysis of published data, a hypothesis about the influence of the species-specific features of number, composition, and distribution of TEs on aging dynamics of different animal genomes was formulated.",

    "abstract": "Protein translation is an essential cellular process playing key roles in growth and development. Protein translation declines over the course of age in multiple animal species, including nematodes, fruit flies, mice, rats, and even humans. In all these species, protein translation transiently peaks in early adulthood with a subsequent drop over the course of age. Conversely, lifelong reductions in protein translation have been found to extend lifespan and healthspan in multiple animal models. These findings raise the protein synthesis paradox: age-related declines in protein synthesis should be detrimental, but life-long reductions in protein translation paradoxically slow down aging and prolong lifespan. This article discusses the nature of this paradox and complies an extensive body of work demonstrating protein translation as a modulator of lifespan and healthspan.",

    "title": "Oxidative stress, inflammation and hormesis: The role of dietary and lifestyle modifications on aging.",
    "abstract": "Oxidative stress (OS) is primarily caused by the formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species; it is considered as one of the prominent factors in slowing down and degrading cellular machinery of an individual, and it eventually leads to aging and age-related diseases by its continuous higher state. The relation between molecular damage and OS should be particularized to understand the beginning of destruction at the cellular levels, extending outwards to affect tissues, organs, and ultimately to the organism. Several OS biomarkers, which are established at the biomolecular level, are useful in investigating the disease susceptibility during aging. Slowing down the aging process is a matter of reducing the rate of oxidative damage to the cellular machinery over time. The breakdown of homeostasis, the mild overcompensation, the reestablishment of homeostasis, and the adaptive nature of the process are the essential features of hormesis, which incorporates several factors, including calorie restriction, nutrition and lifestyle modifications that play an important role in reducing the OS. In the current review, along with the concept and theories of aging (with emphasis on free radical theory), various manifestations of OS with special attention on mitochondrial dysfunction and age-related diseases have been discussed. To alleviate the OS, hormetic approaches including caloric restriction, exercise, and nutrition have also been discussed.",

    "title": "Does generativity matter? A meta-analysis on individual work outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Ongoing demographic changes and global population ageing require organisations to pay special attention to their employment policies. With working life extension and age management increasingly included in discussions about reactive versus proactive personnel policies, the term 'generativity' gains special importance as an approach to managing a generationally diverse workforce. Generativity can be understood as an attitude of openness towards the younger generations that focuses on exchanging values, knowledge, and experiences with them. It is a source of positive emotions and better social relationships, personal fulfilment, good energy, and aliveness. In the paper, generativity is discussed in the framework of two theories: the socio-emotional selectivity theory (SST) and successful ageing theory (SOC). The aim of this paper is to assess the relationship between generativity and individual work outcomes. We considered both in-role and extra-role outcomes analysed in the job context. Meta-analysis is conducted of studies that investigate generativity and its relationships with motivational outcomes (job satisfaction, engagement, work motivation, affective commitment, self-efficacy), cognitive outcomes (attitudes toward retirement, career success, self-control), personal outcomes (wellbeing, health, job strain), relational outcomes and extra-role behaviours (organisational citizenship behaviour and sustainable behaviour). The analysis examines 65 independent samples that included 30,540 individuals, and considers the role of three moderators-the cultural context, the measurement method and age. It demonstrates that generativity has significant and positive motivational, cognitive and extra-role behaviour outcomes for workers and that it improves their well-being.",

The extent to which their assumptions might be justified should be investigated. To this end, various approaches to the possible utility or origin were considered, particularly potential benefits of the faster generational change caused by possible evolutionary compound interest. Reference was made to the thinking of Weismann, the father of regulated aging theories, who advocated non-adaptive concepts at the end of his career.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are over seven million older adult immigrants in the United States, and that number is expected to increase. Older adult immigrants in the United States have unique factors that influence their health.\n\nMETHODS: In this integrative review, we systematically review 20 years of peer-reviewed literature on the barriers (i.e. isolation, lack of English Language Proficiency, low health literacy, lack of SES resources, discrimination) and facilitators (i.e. English Language Proficiency and maintaining ones native language, social support, culturally sensitive providers, healthcare access) of health among older adult immigrants in the United States.\n\nRESULTS: We found differing uses of the term 'older adult', emphasis on the lack of homogeneity among older adult immigrants, social support and isolation as significant barriers and facilitators of older adult immigrant health, and inconsistencies in uses and definitions of acculturation. We also examined relevant theories in the literature. Based on the literature review, focusing on Acculturation Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and Successful Aging Theory, combining these three theories with findings from the literature to create the Older Adult Immigrant Adapted Model for Health Promotion.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Public health strives to promote health and prevent adverse health outcomes. Our integrative review not only systematically and thoroughly explicates 20 years of literature, but the Older Adult Immigrant Adapted Model for Health Promotion, provides guidance for future research and interventions.",

    "title": "The Danaid Theory of Aging.",
    "abstract": "The classical evolutionary theories of aging suggest that aging evolves due to insufficient selective pressure against it. In these theories, declining selection pressure with age leads to aging through genes or resource allocations, implying that aging could potentially be stalled were genes, resource allocation, or selection pressure somewhat different. While these classical evolutionary theories are undeniably part of a description of the evolution of aging, they do not explain the diversity of aging patterns, and they do not constitute the only possible evolutionary explanation. Without denying selection pressure a role in the evolution of aging, we argue that the origin and diversity of aging should also be sought in the nature and evolution of organisms that are, from their very physiological make up, unmaintainable. Drawing on advances in developmental biology, genetics, biochemistry, and complex systems theory since the classical theories emerged, we propose a fresh evolutionary-mechanistic theory of aging, the Danaid theory. We argue that, in complex forms of life like humans, various restrictions on maintenance and repair may be inherent, and we show how such restrictions are laid out during development. We further argue that there is systematic variation in these constraints across taxa, and that this is a crucial factor determining variation in aging and lifespan across the tree of life. Accordingly, the core challenge for the field going forward is to map and understand the mosaic of constraints, trade-offs, chance events, and selective pressures that shape aging in diverse ways across diverse taxa.",

    "title": "The hyperfunction theory: An emerging paradigm for the biology of aging.",
    "abstract": "The process of senescence (aging) is predominantly determined by the action of wild-type genes. For most organisms, this does not reflect any adaptive function that senescence serves, but rather evolutionary effects of declining selection against genes with deleterious effects later in life. To understand aging requires an account of how evolutionary mechanisms give rise to pathogenic gene action and late-life disease, that integrates evolutionary (ultimate) and mechanistic (proximate) causes into a single explanation. A well-supported evolutionary explanation by G.C. Williams argues that senescence can evolve due to pleiotropic effects of alleles with antagonistic effects on fitness and late-life health (antagonistic pleiotropy, AP). What has remained unclear is how gene action gives rise to late-life disease pathophysiology. One ultimate-proximate account is T.B.L. Kirkwood's disposable soma theory. Based on the hypothesis that stochastic molecular damage causes senescence, this reasons that aging is coupled to reproductive fitness due to preferential investment of resources into reproduction, rather than somatic maintenance. An alternative and more recent ultimate-proximate theory argues that aging is largely caused by programmatic, developmental-type mechanisms. Here ideas about AP and programmatic aging are reviewed, particularly those of M.V. Blagosklonny (the hyperfunction theory) and J.P. de Magalhães (the developmental theory), and their capacity to make sense of diverse experimental findings is assessed.",

    "abstract": "Skin ageing is a cumulative result of oxidative stress, predominantly caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Respiration, pollutants, toxins, or ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation produce ROS with 80% of skin damage attributed to UVA irradiation. Anti-ageing peptides and proteins are considered valuable compounds for removing ROS to prevent skin ageing and maintenance of skin health. In this review, skin ageing theory has been illustrated with a focus on the mechanism and relationship with anti-ageing peptides and proteins. The effects, classification, and transport pathways of anti-ageing peptides and proteins across skin are summarized and discussed. Over the last decade, several novel formulations and advanced strategies have been developed to overcome the challenges in the dermal delivery of proteins and peptides for skin ageing. This article also provides an in-depth review of the latest advancements in the dermal delivery of anti-ageing proteins and peptides. Based on these studies, this review prospected several semi-solid dosage forms to achieve topical applicability for anti-ageing peptides and proteins.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary studies on aging and longevity have largely overlooked the role that adaptation plays in lifespan variation across species. Emerging evidence indicates that the genetic signals of extended lifespan may be maintained by natural selection, suggesting that longevity could be a product of organismal adaptation. The mechanisms of adaptation in long-lived animals are believed to account for the modification of physiological function. Here, we first review recent progress in comparative biology of long-lived animals, together with the emergence of adaptive genetic factors that control longevity and disease resistance. We then propose that hitchhiking of adaptive genetic changes is the basis for lifespan changes and suggest ways to test this evolutionary model. As individual adaptive or adaptation-linked mutations/substitutions generate specific forms of longevity effects, the cumulative beneficial effect is largely nonrandom and is indirectly favored by natural selection. We consider this concept in light of other proposed theories of aging and integrate these disparate ideas into an adaptive evolutionary model, highlighting strategies in decoding genetic factors of lifespan control.",

    "title": "Senescence in Bacteria and Its Underlying Mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Bacteria have been thought to flee senescence by dividing into two identical daughter cells, but this notion of immortality has changed over the last two decades. Asymmetry between the resulting daughter cells after binary fission is revealed in physiological function, cell growth, and survival probabilities and is expected from theoretical understanding. Since the discovery of senescence in morphologically identical but physiologically asymmetric dividing bacteria, the mechanisms of bacteria aging have been explored across levels of biological organization. Quantitative investigations are heavily biased toward Escherichia coli and on the role of inclusion bodies-clusters of misfolded proteins. Despite intensive efforts to date, it is not evident if and how inclusion bodies, a phenotype linked to the loss of proteostasis and one of the consequences of a chain of reactions triggered by reactive oxygen species, contribute to senescence in bacteria. Recent findings in bacteria question that inclusion bodies are only deleterious, illustrated by fitness advantages of cells holding inclusion bodies under varying environmental conditions. The contributions of other hallmarks of aging, identified for metazoans, remain elusive. For instance, genomic instability appears to be age independent, epigenetic alterations might be little age specific, and other hallmarks do not play a major role in bacteria systems. What is surprising is that, on the one hand, classical senescence patterns, such as an early exponential increase in mortality followed by late age mortality plateaus, are found, but, on the other hand, identifying mechanisms that link to these patterns is challenging. Senescence patterns are sensitive to environmental conditions and to genetic background, even within species, which suggests diverse evolutionary selective forces on senescence that go beyond generalized expectations of classical evolutionary theories of aging. Given the molecular tool kits available in bacteria, the high control of experimental conditions, the high-throughput data collection using microfluidic systems, and the ease of life cell imaging of fluorescently marked transcription, translation, and proteomic dynamics, in combination with the simple demographics of growth, division, and mortality of bacteria, make the challenges surprising. The diversity of mechanisms and patterns revealed and their environmental dependencies not only present challenges but also open exciting opportunities for the discovery and deeper understanding of aging and its mechanisms, maybe beyond bacteria and aging.",

There is substantial individual variability in the aging process between men and women. In general, women live longer than men, consistent with lower biological ages as assessed by molecular biomarkers, but there is a paradox. Women are frailer and have worse health at the end of life, while men still perform better in physical function examinations. Moreover, many age-related diseases show sex-specific patterns. In this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on sexual dimorphism in human studies, with support from animal research, on biological aging and illnesses. We also attempt to place it in the context of the theories of aging, as well as discuss the explanations for the sex differences, for example, the sex-chromosome linked mechanisms and hormonally driven differences.",

    "abstract": "Aging, in a large measure, has long been defined as the resultant of oxidative stress acting on the cells. The cellular machinery eventually malfunctions at the basic level by the damage from the processes of oxidation and the system starts slowing down because of intrinsic eroding. To understand the initial destruction at the cellular level spreading outward to affect tissues, organs and the organism, the relationship between molecular damage and oxidative stress is required to understand. Retarding the aging process is a matter of cumulatively decreasing the rate of oxidative damage to the cellular machinery. Along with the genetic reasons, the decrease of oxidative stress is somehow a matter of lifestyle and importantly of diet. In the current review, the theories of aging and the understanding of various levels of molecular damage by oxidative stress have been emphasized. A broader understanding of mechanisms of aging have been elaborated in terms of effects of oxidative at molecular, mitochondrial, cellular and organ levels. The antioxidants supplementation, hormesis and calorie restriction as the prominent anti-aging strategies have also been discussed. The relevance and the efficacy of the antiaging strategies at system level have also been presented.",

In this article, we describe the development of an intervention that responds to this need.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Intervention mapping (IM), an evidence-based approach, was used to develop STAYING ACTIVE (STAYing well and active-schedulINg meaninGful and enjoyAble aCTIvities to promote Vitality and wEll-being in mild dementia). The first step, a needs assessment, comprised a literature review, focus groups, and individual interviews with service users. Performance objectives of the intervention were formulated in Step 2, followed by the development of theory-based methods in Step 3. In Step 4, the new intervention was developed based on data collected in previous steps, existing interventions, and pilot testing. Qualitative data were analyzed using framework analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The needs assessment indicated that people with dementia and their carers view \"staying active\" as an important part of \"enjoying life.\" Adapting to loss through compensation and receiving support were key facilitators of engaging in meaningful activity. Ecological, psychosocial, and activity-oriented theories guided the development of theory-based intervention strategies, which were based on awareness, skills, and addressing barriers of meaningful activity.\n\nDISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: STAYING ACTIVE is grounded on theory, and service user experiences and aims at promoting meaningful activity in mild dementia. The IM framework may be useful in the development of future psychosocial interventions for people with dementia, facilitating transparency when efficacy is evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The field of research on cellular senescence experienced a rapid expansion from being primarily focused on in vitro aspects of aging to the vast territories of animal and clinical research. Cellular senescence is defined by a set of markers, many of which are present and accumulate in a gradual manner prior to senescence induction or are found outside of the context of cellular senescence. These markers are now used to measure the impact of cellular senescence on aging and disease as well as outcomes of anti-senescence interventions, many of which are at the stage of clinical trials. It is thus of primary importance to discuss their specificity as well as their role in the establishment of senescence. Here, the presence and role of senescence markers are described in cells prior to cell cycle arrest, especially in the context of replicative aging and in vivo conditions. Specifically, this review article seeks to describe the process of \"cellular aging\": the progression of internal changes occurring in primary cells leading to the induction of cellular senescence and culminating in cell death. Phenotypic changes associated with aging prior to senescence induction will be characterized, as well as their effect on the induction of cell senescence and the final fate of cells reviewed. Using published datasets on assessments of senescence markers in vivo, it will be described how disparities between quantifications can be explained by the concept of cellular aging. Finally, throughout the article the applicational value of broadening cellular senescence paradigm will be discussed.",

There are over 300 \"theories\" of aging and many animal models have been developed ranging from yeast to more complex organisms. Civil age is not a reflection of an individual's physiological age. Starting from the age of 30 a decrease in organ function can be observed. The aging of an individual leads him to 3 states: vigourous, polypathological and dependent or frail. The state of fragility is reversible. We have to be an actor in our aging and no longer suffer it.

While the effects of advanced maternal age have been well documented, only recently have studies started to focus on the impact of advanced paternal age (APA) in the context of male reproduction. As men age, the antioxidant defense system gradually becomes less efficient and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate in spermatozoa; this can impair their functional and structural integrity. In this review, we present an overview of how oxidative stress is implicated in male reproductive aging by providing a summary of the sources and roles of ROS, the theories of aging, and the current animal and human studies that demonstrate the impacts of APA on the male germ line, the health of progeny and fertility, and how treatment with antioxidants may reverse these effects.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the process of aging is still an important challenge to enable healthy aging and to prevent age-related diseases. Most studies in age research investigate the decline in organ functionality and gene activity with age. The focus on decline can even be considered a paradigm in that field. However, there are certain aspects that remain surprisingly stable and keep the organism robust. Here, we present and discuss various properties of robust behavior during human and animal aging, including physiological and molecular biological features, such as the hematocrit, body temperature, immunity against infectious diseases and others. We examine, in the context of robustness, the different theories of how aging occurs. We regard the role of aging in the light of evolution.",

    "abstract": "The current review focuses on the connection of telomerase and telomeres with aging. In this review, we describe the changes in telomerase and telomere length (TEL) during development, their role in carcinogenesis processes, and the consequences of reduced telomerase activity. More specifically, the connection of TEL in peripheral blood cells with the development of aging‑associated diseases is discussed. The review provides systematic data on the role of telomerase in mitochondria, the biology of telomeres in stem cells, as well as the consequences of the forced expression of telomerase (telomerization) in human cells. Additionally, it presents the effects of chronic stress exposure on telomerase activity, the effect of TEL on fertility, and the effect of nutraceutical supplements on TEL. Finally, a comparative review of the chronographic theory of aging, presented by Olovnikov is provided based on currently available scientific research on telomere, telomerase activity, and the nature of aging by multicellular organisms.",

    "title": "The aging lysosome: An essential catalyst for late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomes figure prominently in theories of aging as the proteolytic system most responsible for eliminating growing burdens of damaged proteins and organelles in aging neurons and other long lived cells. Newer evidence shows that diverse experimental measures known to extend lifespan in invertebrate aging models share the property of boosting lysosomal clearance of substrates through the autophagy pathway. Maintaining an optimal level of lysosome acidification is particularly crucial for these anti-aging effects. The exceptional dependence of neurons on fully functional lysosomes is reflected by the neurological phenotypes that develop in congenital lysosomal storage disorders, which commonly present as severe neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative conditions even though the lysosomal deficit maybe systemic. Similar connections are now being appreciated between primary lysosomal deficit and the risk for late age-onset neurodegenerative disorders. In diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as in aging alone, primary lysosome dysfunction due to acidification impairment is emerging as a frequent theme, supported by the growing list of familial neurodegenerative disorders that involve primary vATPase dysfunction. The additional cellular roles played by intraluminal pH in sensing nutrient and stress and modulating cellular signaling have further expanded the possible ways that lysosomal pH dysregulation in aging and disease can disrupt neuronal function. Here, we consider the impact of cellular aging on lysosomes and how the changes during aging may create the tipping point for disease emergence in major late-age onset neurodegenerative disorders.",

From 1952 to 1957, a number of Croatian medical experts gave lectures on gerontology at the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. Based on these lectures, in 1958 the Academy published the first book on gerontology in Croatia under the title Symposium on Gerontology. Its editor was Franjo Kogoj, a dermatovenereologist and a Fellow of the Academy (1894-1983). In this article, we focused on the contents of Symposium, namely, on the discussions about geriatric terminology, theories of aging, epistemological issues in gerontology, as well as clinical experiences with older patients.

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dendrobium Nobile Lindl. (DNL) is one of the central herbs in traditional Chinese medicine which mainly distributes in Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi and other sub-tropical areas south of the Yangtze River. In the past decades, it has been used to treat tumors, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and diseases of the nervous system that may be caused by aging.\n\nAIM OF THE REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the anti-aging information of DNL from the molecular mechanism level, including classic theories related to aging, main chemical components, pharmacological research and anti-aging theory based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, for exploring the future development and clinical treatment.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The information in this paper has been collected from the scientific literature databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, Springer, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, published books, Ph.D. and M.S. dissertations systematically.\n\nRESULTS: In this paper, we have reviewed the several mechanisms underlying the potential effects of DNL on the prevention of aging, including the scavenging of free radicals for oxidation, delaying of DNA impairment, inhibition of apoptosis, and alteration of DNA methylation. Together with the theory of telomeres, this review also has summarized recent research progress in the use of DNL and its traditional efficacy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that \"strengthening Yin and benefiting the spirit\", \"thickening the intestine and stomach\", \"lightning the body and prolonging the life-span\", and delaying aging, are key effects of DNL that can be used to combat age-related diseases (ARDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

Although this theory is used to gauge the extent to which older adults are aging successfully, older adults' experiences and perspectives of what successful aging means to them are missing from the theory. A five-step scoping review framework was used to explore and synthesize the existing research that investigated older adults' perspectives on successful aging. Twelve main themes were found and ranged from the importance of social relationships and interactions to having a good death. Findings indicated older adults do not define successful aging as strictly as is found in the literature. Old age and the aging process from the views of older adults provide future directions for theory development and research.",

    "abstract": "Radical lifespan disparities exist in the animal kingdom. While the ocean quahog can survive for half a millennium, the mayfly survives for less than 48 h. The evolutionary theories of aging seek to explain why such stark longevity differences exist and why a deleterious process like aging evolved. The classical mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and disposable soma theories predict that increased extrinsic mortality should select for the evolution of shorter lifespans and vice versa. Most experimental and comparative field studies conform to this prediction. Indeed, animals with extreme longevity (e.g., Greenland shark, bowhead whale, giant tortoise, vestimentiferan tubeworms) typically experience minimal predation. However, data from guppies, nematodes, and computational models show that increased extrinsic mortality can sometimes lead to longer evolved lifespans. The existence of theoretically immortal animals that experience extrinsic mortality - like planarian flatworms, panther worms, and hydra - further challenges classical assumptions. Octopuses pose another puzzle by exhibiting short lifespans and an uncanny intelligence, the latter of which is often associated with longevity and reduced extrinsic mortality. The evolutionary response to extrinsic mortality is likely dependent on multiple interacting factors in the organism, population, and ecology, including food availability, population density, reproductive cost, age-mortality interactions, and the mortality source.",

Despite its popularity, cellular senescence is weakly defined and is frequently referred to as irreversible cell-cycle arrest.

We provide evidence for the compatibility of the proposed model with recent findings showing senescence in postmitotic tissues, wound healing, obesity, and development. We believe our model also explains why some characteristics of senescence can be found in non-senescent cells. Finally, we propose new avenues for research from our model.",

Therefore, the goal of this review is to verify, in light of some aging theories, the prevalence of AD.\n\nMETHODS: For the purpose of this manuscript, the indexers Alzheimer, aging, Alzheimer, and aging were considered; theories of aging were researched. The research was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Elsevier, and Google Scholar.\n\nRESULTS: The most common subjects in the papers analyzed for this manuscript were aging and Alzheimer's disease. The association between Alzheimer and theories of aging seems inconclusive.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, the general idea is that AD is associated with aging in such a way that almost all people will present this disease; however, it is plausible to consider that the increase in life expectancy will generate a high prevalence of AD. In a general sense, it seems that the theories of aging explain the origin of AD under superlative and catastrophic considerations and use more biomolecular data than social or behavioral data as the bases of analysis, which may be the problem.",

This special issue is a nod to Mike's career and a well-deserved gesture by the neuroscience community thanking him for the impact he has made on many people's careers and the field of basal ganglia physiology. This paper reviews how aging impacts basal ganglia processing with a focus on single cell and synaptic physiology. This review begins with the work Mike did with his collaborators Nat Buchwald, Chester Hull and Jay Schneider. These early studies paved the way for subsequent studies on changes in synaptic processing that occur with aging in the basal ganglia. The primary focus of this review is aging at corticostriatal synapses. Corticostriatal synapses show reduced expression of both short-term and long-term synaptic potentiation. The roles of age-related changes in calcium homeostasis, vesicle cycling, dopamine modulation, and NMDA receptor function in aging's effect on synaptic plasticity are discussed. The article ends with a review of mitochondrial aging theory as it applies to age-induced changes in corticostriatal synaptic function.",

Many different kinds of evidence converge in the concept that life extending manipulations like the dietary restrictions or rapamycin signal the nucleus specifically changing gene expression to increase longevity. The response of the cell aging regulation system is to change the level of activity of many different aging effectors to modulate longevity. Aging effectors include mitROS production, lipid unsaturation, autophagy, mitochondrial DNA repair and possibly others like apoptosis, proteostasis, or telomere shortening, corresponding to different classic theories of aging. The constitutive spontaneous activity of this aging regulating system, likely including epigenetics, can also explain species longevity. The aging regulating system reconciles the previously considered independent theories of aging bringing them together into a single unified theory of aging.",

Thus, the use of MSCs from older donors is lower than younger one, which limits clinical applications in cell therapy. According to the theories of aging, it is determined that aging is most likely caused by telomere shortening and telomere shortening is considered hallmarks of aging. Finding out the most mechanisms of these changes will probably reveal novel therapeutic targets for prolonging human health and for ameliorating age-associated phenotypes.

Thirty years of research are beginning to bear fruit as the first pharmacological interventions based on biology of aging go through clinical trials. Evolutionary theories of aging suggest that naturally selected traits believed to impart fitness in young organisms may be damaging in later life. Three major areas of focus in biology of aging are lifespan, healthspan, and rejuvenation. Areas covered: Aging research has produced several validated pharmacological interventions currently in clinical trials. Herein, the authors consider two representative case studies: 1) rapamycin analogs and their effect on the mTORC1 pathway, and 2) small molecules that target and kill senescent cells. The authors also provide their expert current and future perspectives on aging targeting drug discovery.

    "abstract": "Of the three complementary theories of aging, two (mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy) were formulated over fifty years ago before the introduction of molecular biology, and the third (disposable soma) is over thirty years old. Despite rigorous research in the past fifty years, none have gained substantial experimental support. Here, I review these theories and introduce a new hypothesis called the selfish anti-aging (SAA). Aging happens because natural selection is indifferent to the organism's life beyond reproduction; however, many mammalian species acquired anti-aging genes, which are providing instructions following completion of developmental, ontogeny, program. Such instructor-genes might be responsible for the elongation of lifespans of primates as a byproduct of parental care program. According to the SAA hypothesis, the animal models used in aging research could be divided into three groups, based on the degree of perceived presence and action of instructor-genes in each group. This new hypothesis is grounded in evolutionary theory and describes the unique primate aging process.",

    "abstract": "This review examines the basic theories of aging, showing the irreversibility of this process, leading to the death of cells and the body. The hypotheses of phenotype and apoptosis discussed, the opinion that disadaptation triggers free radical oxidation reactions and violates the neurohumoral regulation of functions. Briefly examines the mechanisms of development of diseases associated with aging. The hypothesis that partial adaptation and disadaptation is a transitional biological process associated with aging is suggested. A regularity used in the reduction of functional activity (the principle of the limitation of cellular metabolism) is described. In the work, it is shown that aging leads to progression of homeostatic disorders, DNA methylation processes change. The question of the use of antioxidants, endogenous peptides, telomerase, ozone to prevent the negative effects of oxidative stress on biomolecules and cellular structures is considered. An opinion is expressed that the biosynthesis of biogenic amines during disadaptation and aging significantly decreases, which entails a decrease in the regulatory control of biochemical reactions from the hypothalamic-pituitary system. It is proposed to consider biogenic amines and their derivatives as substances that minimize dysregulatory processes that reduce disadaptive manifestations in the body, stimulate cellular metabolism and slow the aging process.\n\nВ обзоре рассмотрены основные теории старения, показывающие необратимость данного процесса, приводящего к гибели клеток и организма. Обсуждаются гипотезы феноптоза и апоптоза, высказывается мнение о том, что дезадаптация запускает свободнорадикальные реакции окисления и нарушает нейрогуморальную регуляцию функций. Кратко рассмотрены механизмы развития заболеваний, связанных со старением. Высказано предположение о том, что частичная адаптация и дезадаптация являются переходными биологическими процессами, сопряженными со старением. Описана закономерность, заключающаяся в снижении функциональной активности органа и метаболизма клеток в состоянии дезадаптации и старения (принцип лимитирования клеточного метаболизма). В работе показано, что при старении происходит прогрессирование нарушений гомеостаза, изменяются процессы метилирования ДНК. Рассмотрен вопрос о применении антиоксидантов, эндогенных пептидов, теломеразы, озона для предупреждения негативного влияния окислительного стресса на биомолекулы и клеточные структуры. Высказано мнение, что биосинтез биогенных аминов при дезадаптации и старении заметно снижается, это влечет за собой уменьшение регуляторно-модуляторного контроля биохимических реакций со стороны гипоталамо-гипофизарной системы. Предложено рассматривать биогенные амины и их производные как вещества, минимизирующие дисрегуляторные процессы, уменьшающие дезадаптивные проявления в организме, стимулирующие клеточный метаболизм и замедляющие процесс старения.",

    "abstract": "The aging of our population has been accompanied by increasing concerns about older adults' vulnerability to violations of trust and a growing interest in normative age-related changes to decision making involving social partners. This intersection has spurred research on age-related neurocognitive and affective changes underlying social decision making. Based on our review and synthesis of this literature, we propose a specification that targets social decision making in aging to the recently proposed Affect-Integration-Motivation (AIM) framework. Our framework specification, Changes in Integration for Social Decisions in Aging (CISDA), emphasizes three key components of value integration with particular relevance for social decisions in aging: theory of mind, emotion regulation, and memory for past experience. CISDA builds on converging research from economic decision making, cognitive neuroscience, and lifespan development to outline how age-related changes to neurocognition and behavior impact social decision making. We conclude with recommendations for future research based on CISDA's predictions, including implications for the development of interventions to enhance social decision outcomes in older adults. This article is categorized under: Economics > Individual Decision Making Psychology > Reasoning and Decision Making Psychology > Development and Aging Neuroscience > Cognition.",

    "title": "Operationalized definition of older adults with high cognitive performance.",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies on exceptional cognitive aging. Herein, we aim to objectively provide the operationalized characterization of older adults with unusually high memory ability. Some authors have defined them as \"SuperAgers\", individuals aged 80 years or older with memory ability similar or superior to middle-aged subjects. On the other hand, the terminology \"high-performing older adults\" (HPOA) seems to appropriately conceptualize these individuals without exaggeration. A threshold for age is not a reliable criterion, but may be defined as 75 and 80 years of age for developing and developed countries, respectively. We propose that HPOA may exhibit episodic memory test scores equal to or greater than those of individuals aged 50-60 years, according to the validated tables for the respective country. This group must also have global cognition scores within expected average values for age and education. Executive functioning may play a central role in the exceptional memory performance of this group. Further studies are essential to confirm existing findings and may provide important evidence for cognitive aging theory and the neurobiology of dementia.\n\nO número de estudos sobre envelhecimento cognitivo acima da média vem crescendo recentemente. Neste trabalho, nosso objetivo é fornecer a caracterização operacionalizada de idosos com capacidade de memória excepcionalmente alta. Certos autores definem-nos “Superidosos”, indivíduos com 80 anos ou mais com habilidade de memória similar a adultos de meia-idade. No entanto, a terminologia “idosos de alto desempenho” parece definir de maneira apropriada esses indivíduos, sem restrição excessiva. Apesar de um limite de idade ser imperfeito, ele pode ser definido como 75 ou 80 anos, em países em desenvolvimento ou desenvolvidos, respectivamente. Nós propomos que os idosos de alto desempenho devam ter escores em testes de memória episódica de indivíduos entre 50 a 60 anos, de acordo com tabelas validadas para o país. Esse grupo também deve ter escores de cognição global dentro da média para idade e educação. O funcionamento executivo pode ter um papel central no desempenho excepcional de memória desse grupo. Mais estudos são essenciais para confirmar a existência desses achados e podem fornecer evidência importante para teoria de envelhecimento cognitivo e a neurobiologia das demências.",

    "abstract": "Following the discovery that caloric restriction extends the lifespan of many species of animals, the free radical theory of aging attributes the occurrence of oxidized nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids to reactive oxygen radical species originating from the metabolism of foods and the diminished efficacy of oxidative metabolism. Because of the decline of many critical neuro-hormones in aging, the neuroendocrine theory of aging attributes these changes to reduced feedback control of hormone production by the hypothalamus. Several rare genetic diseases attribute accelerated aging to changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, depletion of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and altered methionine and homocysteine metabolism. The theory of oxidative phosphorylation attributes mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis to the active site, thioretinaco ozonide oxygen NAD+ phosphate, which couples polymerization of NAD+ and phosphate to ATP produced by reduction of oxygen by electrons derived from foods. Loss of the thioretinaco ozonide oxygen ATP complex from the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is proposed to explain the abnormalities of oxidative metabolism occurring in cellular aging and carcinogenesis, thereby uniting the free radical and neuroendocrine theories of aging. Cellular senescence is associated with shortening of telomeres and decreased activity of telomerase, and exposure of cultured endothelial cells to homocysteine causes cellular senescence, shortened telomeres, and increased acidic β-galactosidase, a marker of cellular senescence. The decrease in telomerase with aging is related to decreased nitric oxide production by nitric oxide synthase. The pathogenic microbes occurring in atherosclerotic plaques and in cerebral plaques in dementia inhibit nitric oxide synthesis by up-regulation of polyamine biosynthesis from adenosyl methionine and putrescene, causing the hyperhomocysteinemia and suppressed immunity that is observed in atherosclerosis and dementia. Progressive mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in aging because of loss of the thioretinaco ozonide oxygen ATP complex from mitochondrial membranes by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Melatonin, a neuro-hormone, and cycloastragenol, a telomerase activator, both prevent mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibition of mPTP pore opening. The carcinogenic effects of radiofrequency radiation and mycotoxins are attributed to loss of thioretinaco ozonide from opening of the mPTP and decomposition of the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. The anti-aging effects of retinoids, the decreased concentration of cerebral cobalamin coenzymes in aging, and the diminished concentration of NAD+ from sirtuin activation, as observed in aging, all support the concept of loss of the thioretinaco ozonide oxygen ATP active site from mitochondria as the cause of decreased oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging.",

    "title": "Integrating cellular senescence with the concept of damage accumulation in aging: Relevance for clearance of senescent cells.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the aging process and ways to manipulate it is of major importance for biology and medicine. Among the many aging theories advanced over the years, the concept most consistent with experimental evidence posits the buildup of numerous forms of molecular damage as a foundation of the aging process. Here, we discuss that this concept integrates well with recent findings on cellular senescence, offering a novel view on the role of senescence in aging and age-related disease. Cellular senescence has a well-established role in cellular aging, but its impact on the rate of organismal aging is less defined. One of the most prominent features of cellular senescence is its association with macromolecular damage. The relationship between cell senescence and damage concerns both damage as a molecular signal of senescence induction and accelerated accumulation of damage in senescent cells. We describe the origin, regulatory mechanisms, and relevance of various damage forms in senescent cells. This view on senescent cells as carriers and inducers of damage puts new light on senescence, considering it as a significant contributor to the rise in organismal damage. Applying these ideas, we critically examine current evidence for a role of cellular senescence in aging and age-related diseases. We also discuss the differential impact of longevity interventions on senescence burden and other types of age-related damage. Finally, we propose a model on the role of aging-related damage accumulation and the rate of aging observed upon senescent cell clearance.",

    "title": "Aging, inflammation and the environment.",
    "abstract": "The aging process is driven by interrelated mechanisms that lead to the emergence of characteristic phenotypes that include changes in body composition, energy production and utilization imbalance, homeostatic dysregulation, and neurodegeneration and loss of neuroplasticity. Mainstream theories of aging all recognize that the aging phenotypes result from an imbalance between stressors and stress buffering mechanisms and a resultant loss of compensatory reserve leading to accumulation of unrepaired damage. This in turn results in increased disease susceptibility, reduced functional reserve, reduced healing capacity and stress resistance, unstable health and finally failure to thrive. The resultant physical and cognitive decline that culminates with the frailty syndrome is a tipping point of healthspan and implies a high risk of system decompensation and death. Preserving physical and cognitive function is the main focus of geriatric and gerontological research, but it is important to recognize that accomplishing this goal requires a profound understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms that ultimately determine functional changes. In this context, the proinflammatory state of aging plays a major role. Longitudinal studies have shown that with aging most individuals tend to develop a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state, and that such a state is a strong risk factor for multimorbidity, physical and cognitive disability, frailty and death. A number of environmental factors may play an important role in modifying the proinflammatory state. We explore processes and mechanisms of aging that affect human biology and the possible links of inflammation and the environment to aging, especially those related to metabolism. We point out that longitudinal studies with a life course approach are needed to gain further mechanistic insight on the processes that lead to functional decline with aging, and the role played in this process by inflammation and environmental challenges.",

    "title": "The conceptualization of a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for the reduction of sedentary behavior in older adults.",
    "abstract": "Low physical activity and high sedentary behavior in older adults can be addressed with interventions that are delivered through modern technology. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are an emerging technology-driven behavior-change intervention type and capitalize on data that is collected via mobile sensing technology (e.g., smartphones) to trigger appropriate support in real-life. In this paper we integrated behavior change and aging theory and research as well as knowledge around older adult's technology use to conceptualize a JITAI targeting the reduction of sedentary behavior in older adults. The JITAIs ultimate goal is to encourage older adults to take regular activity breaks from prolonged sitting. As a proximal outcome, we suggest the number of daily activity breaks from sitting. Support provided to interrupt sitting time can be based on tailoring variables: (I) the current accumulated sitting time; (II) the location of the individual; (III) the time of the day; (IV) the frequency of daily support prompts; and (V) the response to previous support prompts. Data on these variables can be collected using sensors that are commonly inbuilt into smartphones (e.g., accelerometer, GPS). Support prompts might be best delivered via traditional text messages as older adults are usually familiar and comfortable with this function. The content of the prompts should encourage breaks from prolonged sitting by highlighting immediate benefits of sitting time interruptions. Additionally, light physical activities that could be done during the breaks should also be presented (e.g., walking into the kitchen to prepare a cup of tea). Although the conceptualized JITAI can be developed and implemented to test its efficacy, more work is required to identify ways to collect, aggregate, organize and immediately use dense data on the proposed and other potentially important tailoring variables. Machine learning and other computational modelling techniques commonly used by computer scientists and engineers appear promising. With this, to develop powerful JITAIs and to actualize the full potential of modern sensing technologies transdisciplinary approaches are required.",

    "title": "[The role of interactions of transposons with epigenetic factors in the aging process].",
    "abstract": "The review considers modern theories of aging mechanisms and data on epigenetic regulation of ontogenesis. Transposons may be the material bases of the epigenetic control system, their movements affect the differentiation of cells and can cause genomic instability. Control systems aimed at protecting against foreign DNA (splicing machine, microRNA processing) became the basis of regulatory networks of genomes underlying cell differentiation. Transposon sequences are the basis for non-coding RNAs that suppress the expression of the transposons themselves and protein-coding genes at the posttranscriptional level, as well as by altering the activity of methyltransferases and modifying the histone modification. Influence on transposons provides a basis for combating aging and age-associated pathologies. In particular, it is possible to influence the change in the length of telomeres, the origin of which is associated with retroelements, by regulating the activity of transposons.\n\nВ обзоре рассмотрены современные теории механизмов старения и данные об эпигенетической регуляции онтогенеза. Материальной основой системы эпигенетического контроля могут быть транспозоны, перемещения которых влияют на дифференцировку клеток и могут вызвать геномную нестабильность. Системы контроля, направленные на защиту против транспозонов (сплайсинговая машина, процессинг микроРНК), стали основой регуляторных сетей геномов, лежащих в основе дифференцировок клеток. Из транспозонных последовательностей формируются некодирующие РНК, подавляющие экспрессию собственных и белок-кодирующих генов на посттранскрипционном уровне и путем изменения активности метилтрансфераз и модификацией гистонов. Регуляция активности транспозонов перспективна для борьбы со старением и возраст-ассоциированными патологиями, в частности воздействием на изменение длины теломер, происхождение которых связано с ретроэлементами.",

    "title": "A Tale of Two Concepts: Harmonizing the Free Radical and Antagonistic Pleiotropy Theories of Aging.",
    "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: The two foremost concepts of aging are the mechanistic free radical theory (FRT) of how we age and the evolutionary antagonistic pleiotropy theory (APT) of why we age. Both date from the late 1950s. The FRT holds that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the principal contributors to the lifelong cumulative damage suffered by cells, whereas the APT is generally understood as positing that genes that are good for young organisms can take over a population even if they are bad for the old organisms. Recent Advances: Here, we provide a common ground for the two theories by showing how aging can result from the inherent chemical reactivity of many biomolecules, not just ROS, which imposes a fundamental constraint on biological evolution. Chemically reactive metabolites spontaneously modify slowly renewable macromolecules in a continuous way over time; the resulting buildup of damage wrought by the genes coding for enzymes that generate such small molecules eventually masquerades as late-acting pleiotropic effects. In aerobic organisms, ROS are major agents of this damage but they are far from alone.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES: Being related to two sides of the same phenomenon, these theories should be compatible. However, the interface between them is obscured by the FRT mistaking a subset of damaging processes for the whole, and the APT mistaking a cumulative quantitative process for a qualitative switch.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS: The manifestations of ROS-mediated cumulative chemical damage at the population level may include the often-observed negative correlation between fitness and the rate of its decline with increasing age, further linking FRT and APT.

    "abstract": "In this mini-review, we survey the extant literature on brain aging, with the emphasis on longitudinal studies of neuroanatomy, including regional brain volumes and white matter microstructure. We assess the impact of vascular, metabolic, and inflammatory risk factors on the trajectories of change in regional brain volumes and white matter properties, as well as the relationships between neuroanatomical and physiological changes and their influence on cognitive performance. We examine these findings in the context of current biological theories of aging and propose the means of integrating noninvasive measures - spectroscopic indices of brain energy metabolism and regional iron deposits - as valuable proxies for elucidating the basic neurobiology of human brain aging. In a brief summary of the recent findings pertaining to age-related changes in the brain structure and their impact on cognition, we discuss the role of vascular, metabolic, and inflammatory risk factors in shaping the trajectories of change. Drawing on the extant biological theories of aging and mindful of the brain's role as a disproportionately voracious energy consumer in mammals, we emphasize the importance of the fundamental bioenergetic mechanisms as drivers of age-related changes in brain structure and function. We sketch out a model that builds on the conceptualization of aging as an expression of cumulative cellular damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species and ensuing declines in energy metabolism. We outline the ways and means of adapting this model, Free-Radical-Induced Energetic and Neural Decline in Senescence (FRIENDS), to human aging and testing it within the constraints of noninvasive neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "It has been historically thought that in conditions that permit growth, most unicellular species do not to age. This was particularly thought to be the case for symmetrically dividing species, as such species lack a clear distinction between the soma and the germline. Despite this, studies of the symmetrically dividing species Escherichia coli and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have recently started to challenge this notion. They indicate that E. coli and S. pombe do age, but only when subjected to environmental stress. If true, this suggests that aging may be widespread among microbial species in general, and that studying aging in microbes may inform other long-standing questions in aging. This review examines the recent evidence for and against replicative aging in symmetrically dividing unicellular organisms, the mechanisms that underlie aging, why aging evolved in these species, and how microbial aging fits into the context of other questions in aging.",

    "abstract": "Although the geroprotectors discovery is a new biomedicine trend and more than 200 compounds can slow aging and increase the lifespan of the model organism, there are still no geroprotectors on the market. The reasons may be partly related to the lack of a unified concept of geroprotector, accepted by the scientific community. Such concept as a system of criteria for geroprotector identification and classification can form a basis for an analytical model of anti-aging drugs, help to consolidate the efforts of various research initiatives in this area and compare their results. Here, we review the existing classification and characteristics of geroprotectors based on their effect on the survival of a group of individuals or pharmaceutics classes, according to the proposed mechanism of their geroprotective action or theories of aging. After discussing advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, we offer a new concept based on the maintenance of homeostatic capacity because aging can be considered as exponential shrinkage of homeostatic capacity leading to the onset of age-related diseases and death. Besides, we review the most promising current screening approaches to finding new geroprotectors. Establishing the classification of existing geroprotectors based on physiology and current understanding of the nature of aging is essential for putting the existing knowledge into a single system. This system could be useful to formulate standards for finding and creating new geroprotectors. Standardization, in turn, would allow easier comparison and combination of experimental data obtained by different research groups.",

Despite numerous empirical investigations, the field lacks a coherent account of the dynamic processes that occur over our lifespan. Taking advantage of the recent developments in whole-brain computational modeling approaches, we hypothesize that the continuous process of aging can be explained by the concepts of metastability - a theoretical framework that gives a systematic account of the variability of the brain.

While many theories exist to explain the aging process, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides a signaling link between engagement of cellular senescence and several age-associated pathologies. Cellular senescence has evolved to restrict tumor progression but the accompanying senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) promotes pathogenic pathways. Here, we review known biological theories of aging and how ROS mechanistically control senescence and the aging process. We also describe the redox-regulated signaling networks controlling the SASP and its important role in driving age-related diseases.

    "abstract": "Famous Free Radical Theory (FRT) of aging, the 50th year anniversary of which is celebrated in 2015 postulates a crucial role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in aging. Still it is the most robust theory of aging as mitochondria ROS production (mtROSp) correlates well with four principal ''rules\" of aging being universal, endogenous, progressive, and deleterious. Vast number of experiments in different species prove mutagenic effect of ROS and their carcinogenic properties. So far, FRT stimulates the search of new pharmaceuticals with antioxidant activity. However, some recent experimental data and clinical findings render doubt to ROS as a principal senescence drivers and come in conflict with original version of FRT. Growth stimulating effects of ROS and their modest antitumor properties support these objections. One should remember that FRT is only one of the numerous theories of aging. Molecular mechanisms of senescence involve all living systems and numerous metabolic pathways which are also variable owing to the unique properties of individual genome and unique epigenetic modulations operating throughout the lifetime thus making aging a unique private matter. Universal theory of aging that incorporates and explains all known and suggested mechanisms of aging, is illusive. However, knowledge of unique peculiarities of individual genome, its feasible editing and efficient epigenetic regulation of metabolic pathways give a chance to postpone aging and extend period of active longevity.",

    "title": "Photoperiodic regulation of behavior: Peromyscus as a model system.",
    "abstract": "Winter and summer present vastly different challenges to animals living outside of the tropics. To survive and reproduce, individuals must anticipate seasonal environmental changes and adjust physiology and behavior accordingly. Photoperiod (day length) offers a relatively 'noise free' environmental signal that non-tropical animals use to tell the time of year, and whether winter is approaching or receding. In some cases, photoperiodic signals may be fine-tuned by other proximate cues such as food availability or temperature. The pineal hormone, melatonin, is a primary physiological transducer of the photoperiodic signal. It tracks night length and provokes changes in physiology and behavior at appropriate times of the year. Because of their wide latitudinal distribution, Peromyscus has been well studied in the context of photoperiodic regulation of physiology and behavior. Here, we discuss how photoperiodic signals are transduced by pineal melatonin, how melatonin acts on target tissues, and subsequent consequences for behavior. Using a life-history paradigm involving trade-offs between the immune and reproductive systems, specific emphasis is placed on aggression, metabolism, and cognition. We discuss future directions including examining the effects of light pollution on photoperiodism, genetic manipulations to test the role of specific genes in the photoperiodic response, and using Peromyscus to test evolutionary theories of aging.",

    "title": "Aging: progressive decline in fitness due to the rising deleteriome adjusted by genetic, environmental, and stochastic processes.",
    "abstract": "Different theories posit that aging is caused by molecular damage, genetic programs, continued development, hyperfunction, antagonistic pleiotropy alleles, mutations, trade-offs, incomplete repair, etc. Here, I discuss that these ideas can be conceptually unified as they capture particular facets of aging, while being incomplete. Their respective deleterious effects impact fitness at different levels of biological organization, adjusting progression through aging, rather than causing it. Living is associated with a myriad of deleterious processes, both random and deterministic, which are caused by imperfectness, exhibit cumulative properties, and represent the indirect effects of biological functions at all levels, from simple molecules to systems. From this, I derive the deleteriome, which encompasses cumulative deleterious age-related changes and represents the biological age. The organismal deleteriome consists of the deleteriomes of cells, organs, and systems, which change along roughly synchronized trajectories and may be assessed through biomarkers of aging. Aging is then a progressive decline in fitness due to the increasing deleteriome, adjusted by genetic, environmental, and stochastic processes. This model allows integration of diverse aging concepts, provides insights into the nature of aging, and suggests how lifespan may be adjusted during evolution and in experimental models.",

It is also a particularly significant health problem in older populations since half of all malignancies occur in patients aged 70 years or older. Cancer is a disease of aging, and as such there is a strong biological association between the mechanisms of aging and carcinogenesis. During the past few decades, mechanisms of aging exerting pro- and anti-oncogenic effects have been described, and the role of these mechanisms in cancer treatment and prognosis is currently being investigated. In this review we describe the different theories of aging and the evidence on the biological link between these mechanisms and carcinogenesis. Additionally, we review the implications of the biology of aging on the treatment and prognosis of older adults with cancer, and the opportunities for translational research into biomarkers of aging in this patient population.",

Drug therapies are symptomatic and inadequate to contrast disease progression and mortality. Thus, there is an urgent need to clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for this condition in order to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Processes including oxidant/antioxidant, protease/antiprotease, and proliferative/antiproliferative balance and control of inflammatory response become dysfunctional during aging as well as in COPD. Recently it was suggested that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an antiaging molecule involved in the response to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, is implicated in both development and progression of COPD. The present review focuses on the involvement of SIRT1 in the regulation of redox state, inflammation, and premature senescence, all crucial characteristics of COPD phenotypes. Recent evidence corroborating the statement of the \"aging theory for COPD\" was also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The longstanding debate about whether aging may have evolved for some adaptive reason is generally considered to pit evolutionary theory against empirical observations consistent with aging as a programmed aspect of organismal biology, in particular conserved aging genes. Here I argue that the empirical evidence on aging mechanisms does not support a view of aging as a programmed phenomenon, but rather supports a view of aging as the dysregulation of complex networks that maintain organismal homeostasis. The appearance of programming is due largely to the inadvertent activation of existing pathways during the process of dysregulation. It is argued that aging differs markedly from known programmed biological phenomena such as apoptosis in that it is (a) very heterogeneous in how it proceeds, and (b) much slower than it would need to be. Furthermore, the taxonomic distribution of aging across species does not support any proposed adaptive theories of aging, which would predict that aging rate would vary on a finer taxonomic scale depending on factors such as population density. Thus, while there are problems with the longstanding non-adaptive paradigm, current evidence does not support the notion that aging is programmed or that it may have evolved for adaptive reasons.",

    "abstract": "In contraposition to the view of aging as a stochastic time-dependent accumulation of damage, phenoptotic theories of aging postulate that senescence may provide supra-individual advantages, and therefore it might have been promoted by natural selection. We reason that although programmed aging theories are subjectively appealing because they convey a cure for aging, they also raise a number of objections that need to be dealt with, before we may be entitled to contemplate aging as an adaptive function evolved through natural selection. As an alternative view, we present metabolism as an endless source of by-products and errors causing cellular damage. Although this damage accumulation event is a spontaneous entropy-driven process, its kinetics can be genetically and environmentally modulated, giving place to the wide range of lifespans we observe. Mild forms of damage may be accumulating during a long enough period of time to allow reproduction before the fatal failure happens. Hence, aging would be a stochastic process out of the reach of natural selection. However, those genetic pathways influencing the rate of aging and consequently determining longevity may be targets of natural selection and may contribute to shaping the optimal strategy according to the ecological context. In this sense, short- and long-lived organisms represent two extreme strategies that, in terms of biological fitness, can perform equally well, each within its own niche.",

    "abstract": "There have long been suggestions that aging is tightly linked to the complex dynamics of the physiological systems that maintain homeostasis, and in particular to dysregulation of regulatory networks of molecules. This review synthesizes recent work that is starting to provide evidence for the importance of such complex systems dynamics in aging. There is now clear evidence that physiological dysregulation--the gradual breakdown in the capacity of complex regulatory networks to maintain homeostasis--is an emergent property of these regulatory networks, and that it plays an important role in aging. It can be measured simply using small numbers of biomarkers. Additionally, there are indications of the importance during aging of emergent physiological processes, functional processes that cannot be easily understood through clear metabolic pathways, but can nonetheless be precisely quantified and studied. The overall role of such complex systems dynamics in aging remains an important open question, and to understand it future studies will need to distinguish and integrate related aspects of aging research, including multi-factorial theories of aging, systems biology, bioinformatics, network approaches, robustness, and loss of complexity.",

Intrinsic mortality is assumed to be a result of aging and to increase over age, whereas extrinsic mortality is assumed to be a result of environmental hazards and be constant over age. However, allegedly intrinsic and extrinsic mortality have an exponentially increasing age pattern in common. Theories of aging assert that a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors underlies the increasing risk of death. Epidemiological and biological data support that the control of intrinsic as well as extrinsic stressors can alleviate the aging process. We argue that aging and death can be better explained by the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors than by classifying mortality itself as being either intrinsic or extrinsic. Recognition of the tight interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic stressors in the causation of aging leads to the recognition that aging is not inevitable, but malleable through the environment.",

    "title": "Systems biology of aging.",
    "abstract": "Human aging occurs at rates that vary widely between organisms and cell types. We hypothesize that in both cases, variation is due to differences in heat production, heat management and molecular susceptibility to heat-induced change. Metabolic rates have long been implored for their contributions to the aging process, with a negative correlation observed between basal metabolic rate and lifespan (Savage et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104:4718–4723, 2007, Economos, Exp Gerontol 17:145–152, 1982, Keys et al., Metabolism 22:579–587, 1973, O’Connor et al., Comp Biochem Physiol Part A, Molr & Integr Physiol 133:835–842, 2002, Speakman, J Exp Biol 208:1717–1730, 2005, Poehlman, J Am Geriatrics Soc 41:552–559, 1993). Small amounts of heat are the well-known byproduct of metabolism and other biological processes, and despite their magnitude, are sufficient to elicit alterations in biomolecular characteristics (Somero, Ann Rev Physiol 57:43–68, 1995). Existing theories of aging suggest that damage occurs to the conformations or sequences of molecules, which only shifts focus onto the implied failure of repair mechanisms. Contrarily, heat-induced changes affect the behavioral characteristics of molecules and are thus able to persist “under the radar” of heat shock proteins and other canalizing mechanisms, which recognize only physical aberrancies (Rutherford and Lindquist, Nature 396:336–342, 1998, Siegal and Bergman, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 99:10528–10532, 2002, Waddington, Nature 150:563–565, 1942). According to our hypothesis, behavioral changes to the binding affinities, kinetics, motilities, and functionalities are dependent on minute energetic fields within and between molecules. Exposure to the thermal byproducts of metabolism cause heritable shifts in molecular interaction schemes and diminish the integrity of genetic and epigenetic networks. Restructured topologies alter the emergent properties of networks and are observed as the increased variation and decreased functionality associated with “aging” (Moorad and Promislow, Proc Royal Soc B Biol Sci 276:2271–2278, 2009, Soltow et al., Integr Comp Biol 50:844–854, 2010, Siegal et al.,Genetica 129:83–103, 2007, Promislow,Proc Biol sci/The Royal Soc 271:1225–1234, 2004, Southworth et al., PLoS Genet 5:e1000776, 2009, Rodwell et al.,PLoS Biol 2:e427, 2004). A major hurdle in the development of this hypothesis was overcome with the discovery of protein moonlighting: the phenomenon by which proteins assume drastically different functions independent of conformational change (Jeffery, Trends Biochem Sci 24:8–11, 1999). This molecular mechanism validates the hypothesis that network and behavioral changes can undergo somatic inheritance, and be accumulated by daughter cells over the course of a lifetime. Once a damage threshold has been surpassed, a system can no longer sustain life, and death results.",

    "abstract": "According to prominent theories of aging, the brain may reorganize to compensate for neural deterioration and prevent or offset cognitive decline. A frequent and striking finding in functional imaging studies is that older adults recruit additional regions relative to young adults performing the same task. This is often interpreted as evidence for functional reorganization, suggesting that, as people age, different regions or networks may support the same cognitive functions. Associations between additional recruitment and better performance in older adults have led to the suggestion that the additional recruitment may contribute to preserved cognitive function in old age and may explain some of the variation among individuals in preservation of function. However, many alternative explanations are possible, and recent findings and methodological developments have highlighted the need for more systematic approaches to determine whether reorganization occurs with age and whether it benefits performance. We reevaluate current evidence for compensatory functional reorganization in the light of recent moves to address these challenges.",

Present-day telomerase theory of aging gains a new impetus, shedding light upon the influence of psychological state of humans and their ability to counteract stress, upon the process of aging. It also tends to regard telomere shortening and the decrease in the activity of telomerase as a marker of level of the ability to adapt to both inner and outer influences. Both aging and age-dependent diseases are proved to be substantially retarded not only by the administration of drugs, but also by psychological means, which forms a good way towards healthy longevity. With complete understanding of the impossibility to prevent or even to slow down natural senescence itself, these methods allow to remove causes, which accelerate senescence, and to increase the average human longevity.\n\nОбзор посвящен анализу имеющихся данных о возможном влиянии стресса на длину теломер и активность теломеразы и разных способов противостояния ему.

Накопленные к настоящему времени результаты показывают, что ускоренное старение, сопровождающее возраст-ассоциированные заболевания, может быть существенно замедлено не только медикаментозными, но и психологическими методами, что крайне важно для создания предпосылок к здоровому долголетию. При полном понимании невозможности предотвратить или даже существенно замедлить естественное старение, применение этих методов позволяет снять ускоряющие старение факторы и увеличить, тем самым, среднюю продолжительность активной жизни человека.",

This situation stems to a large extent from a fact that aging may be considered at various levels, starting from whole populations, through individual organisms, tissues and organs, ending on particular cell types. This complexity has determined currently functioning division of aging theories into evolutionary and mechanistic. First group aims at answering the question \"why do we age?\" and determining a biological purpose of this process. Mechanistic theories, in turn, try to answer the question \"how do we age?\" in terms of direct reasons of adverse changes that appear in organisms with age.

    "abstract": "Advances in medical science and technology allow people live longer lives, which results in age-related problems. Humans cannot avoid the various aged-related alterations of aging; in other words, humans cannot remain young at molecular and cellular levels. In 1956, Harman proposed the \"free radical theory of aging\" to explain the molecular mechanisms of aging. Telomere length, and accumulation of DNA or mitochondrial damage are also considered to be mechanisms of aging. On the other hand, stem cells are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis by replacing parenchymal cells; therefore, the stem cell theory of aging is also used to explain the progress of aging. Importantly, the stem cell theory of aging is likely related to other theories. In addition, recent studies have started to reveal the essential roles of tissue-resident mesenchymal progenitors/stem cells/stromal cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and some evidence of their fundamental roles in the progression of aging has been presented. In this review, we discuss how stem cell and other theories connect to explain the progress of aging. In addition, we consider the mesenchymal progenitor theory of aging to describing the process of aging.",

    "title": "[The role of reactive oxygen species and mitochondria in aging].",
    "abstract": "Aging is a biological phenomenon concerning all living multicellular organisms. Many studies have been conducted to identify the mechanisms underlying this process. To date, multiple theories have been proposed to explain the causes of aging. One of them is the free radical theory which postulates that reactive oxygen species (ROS), extremely reactive chemical molecules, are the major cause of the aging process. These free radicals are mainly produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain as a result of electron transport and the reduction of the oxygen molecule. Toxic effects of ROS on cellular components lead to accumulation of oxidative damage which causes cellular dysfunction with age. The free radical theory has been one of the most popular theories of aging for many years. Scientific research on different model organisms aiming to verify the theory has produced abundant data, supporting the theory or, on the contrary, suggesting strong evidence against it. At present, the free radical theory of aging is no longer considered to be true.",

    "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: Aging and oxidative stress are complex phenomena, and their understanding is of enormous theoretical and practical significance.\n\nRECENT ADVANCES: Numerous hypotheses and theories that attempt to explain these phenomena have been developed. These hypotheses and theories compete with each other, with each claiming to be the correct one, while significantly contradicting each other.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES: It is important to develop a maximally correct theory that may then trigger significant practical breakthroughs.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS: None of these theories is entirely correct or close enough to the truth. However, most of them contain many correct elements (CE). Finding these CE is possible by analysis of these theories. Once the CE are found, they can be merged by synthesis in a better new theory. An analysis of some of the theories of aging followed by synthesis is attempted.",

Today, both theoretical perspectives emphasize adaptation as a time-dependent, multidimensional, nonlinear, and multidirectional process. Immigrant incorporation theories have not fully engaged with a key concern of aging theory-why there are age differences. Insights from cognitive aging and developmental biology, life-span developmental psychology, and age stratification and the life course suggest explanations for age differences in the speed of immigrant incorporation.\n\nDISCUSSION: Theories of adaptation to aging and theories of immigrant incorporation developed so independently that they neglected the subject they have in common, namely, older immigrants. Because they address similar conceptual problems and share key assumptions, a productive dialogue between two vibrant fields is long overdue.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theories of aging explain why we age. These theories take into account the fact that, in the wild, mean lifespan of many species is usually shorter than it could be in protected environments. In such conditions, because most of animals die before reaching old age, there is no selection in favor or against alleles with effects at old age. Alleles with negative effects at this age can thus accumulate in successive generations, particularly if they also have positive effects at young age and are thus retained by selection. This chapter describes the evolutionary theories of aging and their consequences for the understanding of the biology of aging as well as the challenges to these theories. It is argued that these theories offer a reasonable explanation to the existence of the aging process even if they can surely be refined.",

Indeed, the study of human and animal genetics is gradually identifying new genes that increase lifespan when overexpressed or mutated: gerontogenes. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are being identified that have a positive effect on longevity. The gerontogenes are classified as lifespan regulators, mediators, effectors, housekeeping genes, genes involved in mitochondrial function, and genes regulating cellular senescence and apoptosis. In this review we demonstrate that the majority of the genes as well as genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in regulation of longevity are highly interconnected and related to stress response.",

    "title": "Melatonin and the theories of aging: a critical appraisal of melatonin's role in antiaging mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "The classic theories of aging such as the free radical theory, including its mitochondria-related versions, have largely focused on a few specific processes of senescence. Meanwhile, numerous interconnections have become apparent between age-dependent changes previously thought to proceed more or less independently. Increased damage by free radicals is not only linked to impairments of mitochondrial function, but also to inflammaging as it occurs during immune remodeling and by release of proinflammatory cytokines from mitotically arrested, DNA-damaged cells that exhibit the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Among other effects, SASP can cause mutations in stem cells that reduce the capacity for tissue regeneration or, in worst case, lead to cancer stem cells. Oxidative stress has also been shown to promote telomere attrition. Moreover, damage by free radicals is connected to impaired circadian rhythmicity. Another nexus exists between cellular oscillators and metabolic sensing, in particular to the aging-suppressor SIRT1, which acts as an accessory clock protein. Melatonin, being a highly pleiotropic regulator molecule, interacts directly or indirectly with all the processes mentioned. These influences are critically reviewed, with emphasis on data from aged organisms and senescence-accelerated animals. The sometimes-controversial findings obtained either in a nongerontological context or in comparisons of tumor with nontumor cells are discussed in light of evidence obtained in senescent organisms. Although, in mammals, lifetime extension by melatonin has been rarely documented in a fully conclusive way, a support of healthy aging has been observed in rodents and is highly likely in humans.",

    "title": "The decay of stem cell nourishment at the niche.",
    "abstract": "One of the main features of human aging is the loss of adult stem cell homeostasis. Organs that are very dependent on adult stem cells show increased susceptibility to aging, particularly organs that present a vascular stem cell niche. Reduced regenerative capacity in tissues correlates with reduced stem cell function, which parallels a loss of microvascular density (rarefraction) and plasticity. Moreover, the age-related loss of microvascular plasticity and rarefaction has significance beyond metabolic support for tissues because stem cell niches are regulated co-ordinately with the vascular cells. In addition, microvascular rarefaction is related to increased inflammatory signals that may negatively regulate the stem cell population. Thus, the processes of microvascular rarefaction, adult stem cell dysfunction, and inflammation underlie the cycle of physiological decline that we call aging. Observations from new mouse models and humans are discussed here to support the vascular aging theory. We develop a novel theory to explain the complexity of aging in mammals and perhaps in other organisms. The connection between vascular endothelial tissue and organismal aging provides a potential evolutionary conserved mechanism that is an ideal target for the development of therapies to prevent or delay age-related processes in humans.",

    "abstract": "The main questions posed in ageing theories are how ageing evolved and whether or not it is programmed. While these questions have not yet been clearly resolved, several groups of possible theories have been published on this topic. However, most of these theories do not consider plants, and the specific traits involved in their ageing mechanisms. The first trait covers clonality and sectoriality and the second concerns the lack of a differentiated germ line. The lack of a germ line prevents telomere shortening which can lead to the transfer of somatic mutations into sexual offspring, while sectoriality in trees causes isolation of potentially catastrophic events in one tree part, thus creating a population of more or less independent modules within one axis. The processes of population dynamics, including ageing, can act within the framework of an individual tree as well as in that of the population as a whole, although the processes involved differ and consequently result in different effects.",

    "abstract": "The liver is the only internal human organ capable of natural regeneration of lost tissue, as little as 25% of a liver can regenerate into a whole liver. The process of aging predisposes to hepatic functional and structural impairment and metabolic risk. Therefore, understanding how aging could affect the molecular pathology of liver diseases is particularly important, and few studies to date have tackled this complex process. The most common liver disease, affecting one-third of the overall population, is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by an intrahepatic accumulation of lipids. NAFLD can evolve into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the presence of oxidative stress and inflammation. NASH is a serious risk factor for disabling and deadly liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Old age seems to favor NAFLD, NASH, and ultimately HCC, in agreement with the inflamm-aging theory, according to which aging accrues inflammation. However, the incidence of HCC drops significantly in the very elderly (individuals aged more than 70) and the relationship between the progression of NAFLD/NASH/HCC and very old age is obscure. In this review, we discuss the literature and we argue that there might be an age window in which the liver becomes resistant to the development of injury; this needs to be studied to understand fully the interaction between age and liver diseases from a therapeutic perspective.",

    "abstract": "It is tempting to assume that a gradual accumulation of damage 'causes' an organism to age, but other biological processes present during the lifespan, whether 'programmed' or 'hijacked', could control the type and speed of aging. Theories of aging have classically focused on changes at the genomic level; however, individuals with similar genetic backgrounds can age very differently. Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications and ncRNA. Environmental cues may be 'remembered' during lifespan through changes to the epigenome that affect the rate of aging. Changes to the epigenomic landscape are now known to associate with aging, but so far causal links to longevity are only beginning to be revealed. Nevertheless, it is becoming apparent that there is significant reciprocal regulation occurring between the epigenomic levels. Future work utilizing new technologies and techniques should build a clearer picture of the link between epigenomic changes and aging.",

    "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: The oxidative stress theory of aging has been the most widely accepted theory of aging providing insights into why we age and die for over 50 years, despite mounting evidence from a multitude of species indicating that there is no direct relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and longevity. Here we explore how different species, including the longest lived rodent, the naked mole-rat, have defied the most predominant aging theory.\n\nRECENT ADVANCES: In the case of extremely long-lived naked mole-rat, levels of ROS production are found to be similar to mice, antioxidant defenses unexceptional, and even under constitutive conditions, naked mole-rats combine a pro-oxidant intracellular milieu with high, steady state levels of oxidative damage. Clearly, naked mole-rats can tolerate this level of oxidative stress and must have mechanisms in place to prevent its translation into potentially lethal diseases.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES: In addition to the naked mole-rat, other species from across the phylogenetic spectrum and even certain mouse strains do not support this theory. Moreover, overexpressing or knocking down antioxidant levels alters levels of oxidative damage and even cancer incidence, but does not modulate lifespan.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS: Perhaps, it is not oxidative stress that modulates healthspan and longevity, but other cytoprotective mechanisms that allow animals to deal with high levels of oxidative damage and stress, and nevertheless live long, relatively healthy lifespans. Studying these mechanisms in uniquely long-lived species, like the naked mole-rat, may help us tease out the key contributors to aging and longevity.",

Kirkwood (1977) Nature, 270, 301-304), and it is not surprising that interpreters of demographic data seek to frame their results in this context. But some of that evidence finds a much more natural explanation in terms of adaptive aging. Here we re-interpret the 1997 results of the Centenarian Study in Boston, which found in their sample of centenarian women an excess of late childbearing. The finding was originally interpreted as a selection effect: a metabolic link between late menopause and longevity. But we demonstrate that this interpretation is statistically strained, and that the data in fact indicate a causal link: bearing a child late in life induces a metabolic response that promotes longevity. This conclusion directly contradicts some pleiotropic theories of aging that postulate a \"cost of reproduction\", and it supports theories of aging as an adaptive genetic program.",

One area of interest has been the importance of genomic stability for age-related processes, and the potential conservation of proteins and pathways between yeast and human. Translational genetics have been employed to examine the functional roles of mammalian proteins using yeast as a pliable model system. In the current review recent advancements made in this area are discussed, highlighting work which shows that the cellular functions of human proteins in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability can be elucidated by genetic rescue experiments performed in yeast.",

    "abstract": "With an expanding aging population, it is increasingly important to gain a better understanding of the changes in cognition and neural integrity that occur in normal aging. The advent of non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques has spurred researchers to examine cognition and neural functioning in healthy older adults. A significant amount of research has been produced since this time and has led to influential theories of aging such as the hemispheric asymmetry reduction for older adults (HAROLD) model and the compensatory recruitment hypothesis. This chapter discusses advances in our understanding of normal aging achieved through the use of functional neuroimaging. Research examining age-related changes in domains such as attention, memory, and executive functioning, as well as imaging of the resting-state and the influences of genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype), are discussed. In conclusion, limitations of the current literature and important avenues for future research are proposed.",

    "title": "Age differences in brain activity during emotion processing: reflections of age-related decline or increased emotion regulation?",
    "abstract": "Despite the fact that physical health and cognitive abilities decline with aging, the ability to regulate emotion remains stable and in some aspects improves across the adult life span. Older adults also show a positivity effect in their attention and memory, with diminished processing of negative stimuli relative to positive stimuli compared with younger adults. The current paper reviews functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating age-related differences in emotional processing and discusses how this evidence relates to two opposing theoretical accounts of older adults' positivity effect. The aging-brain model [Cacioppo et al. in: Social Neuroscience: Toward Understanding the Underpinnings of the Social Mind. New York, Oxford University Press, 2011] proposes that older adults' positivity effect is a consequence of age-related decline in the amygdala, whereas the cognitive control hypothesis [Kryla-Lighthall and Mather in: Handbook of Theories of Aging, ed 2. New York, Springer, 2009; Mather and Carstensen: Trends Cogn Sci 2005;9:496-502; Mather and Knight: Psychol Aging 2005;20:554-570] argues that the positivity effect is a result of older adults' greater focus on regulating emotion. Based on evidence for structural and functional preservation of the amygdala in older adults and findings that older adults show greater prefrontal cortex activity than younger adults while engaging in emotion-processing tasks, we argue that the cognitive control hypothesis is a more likely explanation for older adults' positivity effect than the aging-brain model.",

    "title": "A network perspective on metabolism and aging.",
    "abstract": "Aging affects a myriad of genetic, biochemical, and metabolic processes, and efforts to understand the underlying molecular basis of aging are often thwarted by the complexity of the aging process. By taking a systems biology approach, network analysis is well-suited to study the decline in function with age. Network analysis has already been utilized in describing other complex processes such as development, evolution, and robustness. Networks of gene expression and protein-protein interaction have provided valuable insight into the loss of connectivity and network structure throughout lifespan. Here, we advocate the use of metabolic networks to expand the work from genomics and proteomics. As metabolism is the final fingerprint of functionality and has been implicated in multiple theories of aging, metabolomic methods combined with metabolite network analyses should pave the way to investigate how relationships of metabolites change with age and how these interactions affect phenotype and function of the aging individual. The metabolomic network approaches highlighted in this review are fundamental for an understanding of systematic declines and of failure to function with age.",

    "abstract": "The most prevalent hypothesis concerning the relationship between reproduction and longevity predicts that reproduction is costly, particularly in females. Specifically, egg production and sexual harassment of females by males reduce female longevity. This may apply to some short-lived species such as Drosophila, but not to some long-lived species such as the queens of ants and bees. Bee queens lay up to 2000 eggs a day for several years, but they nevertheless live at least 20 times longer than their sisters, the sterile workers. This discrepancy necessitates a critical reevaluation of the validity of both the trade-off concept as such, and of the current theories of aging. The widely accepted oxidative stress theory of aging with its links to metabolism and the insulin/IGF-I system has been disproven in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice, but not in Drosophila, necessitating other approaches. The recent spermidine/mitophagy theory is gaining momentum. Two major mechanisms may have been largely overlooked, namely epigenetic control of longevity by imprinting through DNA methylation as suggested by recent data in the honey bee, and especially, a mechanism of which the principles are outlined here, the progressive weakening of the \"electrical dimension\" of cells up to the point of total collapse, namely death.",

Ideally, technology will make the task easier, more efficient, safer, or perhaps more pleasurable. Unfortunately, new technologies can sometimes make a task more difficult, slower, dangerous, or perhaps more frustrating. Older adults interact with a variety of technologies in the course of their daily activities and thus products should be designed to be used by people of varying ages.\n\nMETHODS: In this article, we provide an overview of what psychology has to offer to the design of technology-from understanding what people need, to identifying their preferences for design characteristics, and to defining their capabilities and limitations that will influence technology interactions.\n\nRESULTS: We identify how research in the field of psychology and aging has advanced understanding of technology interactions and how research on technology interactions can inform theories of aging.\n\nDISCUSSION: Design for aging involves understanding the unique capabilities and limitations of older adults; identifying their needs, preferences, and desires for technology in their lives; and involving them in the design process.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine how often theory is used in published research in social gerontology, compare theory use over a 10-year period (1990-1994 to 2000-2004), and identify the theories most frequently used in social gerontology research.\n\nMETHODS: Systematic review of articles published in eight leading journals from 2000 to 2004 (N = 1,046) and comparison with a review conducted 10 years earlier.\n\nRESULTS: Theory was mentioned in 39% of articles published from 2000 to 2004, representing a 12% increase in the use of theory over 10 years. This increase was driven by theories outside the core sociology of aging theories identified by Bengtson, V. L., Burgess, E. O., and Parrott, T. M. (1997). Theory, explanation, and a third generation of theoretical development in social gerontology. Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 52B, S72-S88. The five most frequently used theories included the life course perspective, life-span developmental theories, role theory, exchange theory, and person-environment theory/ecological theories of aging. Commonly used models included stress process/stress and coping models, successful aging models, the Andersen behavioral model of health services use, models of control/self-efficacy/mastery, and disablement process models.\n\nDISCUSSION: Theory use in social gerontology increased between 1990 and 2004, with a shift toward theories that cross disciplines. However, the majority of research in social gerontology continues to be atheoretical. Models are widely used as a supplement to or substitute for theory. Many of these models are currently being debated and elaborated, and over time, they may emerge as important theoretical contributions to social gerontology.",

    "abstract": "The study of radiation effect in Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans has been carried out over three decades and now allow for understanding at the molecular, cellular and individual levels. This review describes the current knowledge of the biological effects of ionizing irradiation with a scope of the germ line, aging and behavior. In germ cells, ionizing radiation induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Lots of molecules involved in these responses and functions have been identified in C. elegans, which are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes. Radiosensitivity and the effect of heavy-ion microbeam irradiation on germ cells with relationship between initiation of meiotic recombination and DNA lesions are discussed. In addition to DNA damage, ionizing radiation produces free radicals, and the free radical theory is the most popular aging theory. A first signal transduction pathway of aging has been discovered in C. elegans, and radiation-induced metabolic oxidative stress is recently noted for an inducible factor of hormetic response and genetic instability. The hormetic response in C. elegans exposed to oxidative stress is discussed with genetic pathways of aging. Moreover, C. elegans is well known as a model organism for behavior. The recent work reported the radiation effects via specific neurons on learning behavior, and radiation and hydrogen peroxide affect the locomotory rate similarly. These findings are discussed in relation to the evidence obtained with other organisms. Altogether, C. elegans may be a good \"in vivo\" model system in the field of radiation biology.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical phenomenon of aging, as universal as it is, still remains poorly understood. A number of diseases are associated with aging either as a cause or consequence of the aging process. The incidence of human cancers increases exponentially with age and therefore cancer stands out as a disease that is intricately connected to the process of aging. Emerging evidence clearly suggests that there is a symbiotic relationship between aging, inflammation and chronic diseases such as cancer; however, it is not clear whether aging leads to the induction of inflammatory processes thereby resulting in the development and maintenance of chronic diseases or whether inflammation is the causative factor for inducing both aging and chronic diseases such as cancer. Moreover, the development of chronic diseases especially cancer could also lead to the induction of inflammatory processes and may cause premature aging, suggesting that longitudinal research strategies must be employed for dissecting the interrelationships between aging, inflammation and cancer. Here, we have described our current understanding on the importance of inflammation, activation of NF-kappaB and various cytokines and chemokines in the processes of aging and in the development of chronic diseases especially cancer. We have also reviewed the prevailing theories of aging and provided succinct evidence in support of novel theories such as those involving cancer stem cells, the molecular understanding of which would likely hold a great promise towards unraveling the complex relationships between aging, inflammation and cancer.",

Pleiotropic theories of aging predict that it should, and in particular, the Disposable Soma theory predicts unequivocally that this effect should be inescapable. But many demographic studies, historic and current, have found no such effect. In this context,the Caerphilly cohort study stands apart as the sole test that corroborates the theory. Why has this study found an effect that others fail to see? Their analysis is based on Poisson regression, a statistical technique that is accurate only if the underlying data are Poisson distributed.But the distribution of the number of children born to women in the Caerphilly data based departs strongly from Poisson at the high end. This makes the result overly sensitive to a handful of women with 15 children or more who lived before 1700. When these five women are removed from a database of more than 2,900, the Poisson regression no longer shows a significant result. Bilinear regression relating life span to fertility and date of birth results in a small positive coefficient for fertility, in agreement with the main trend of reported results.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous ageing is responsible for the increasingly creased appearance of the skin, pores opening, skin dyschromia, while the ageing of the structures of the face is attributed primarily to the effect of gravity on the tissues. The theory expounded below sets out to prove that the main and initial cause of this ageing is the repeated contractions of the mimic muscles. This concept attributes only a secondary role to gravity in the ageing process, which is initially brought about by muscular contractions. An MRI study recently made it possible to demonstrate the anterior convexity curve of the mimic muscles in the young subject. This curve is due to the existence of a deep fat pad at the back of these muscles. While this mass of fat is effectively a mechanical sliding plane, its convexity constitutes the founding principle behind this new ageing theory. In the young subject, the extent of its convexity and its location give a specific, youthful character to the movements, in terms of direction and amplitude, of the facial muscles. With age, the muscle gradually straightens and shortens, due to the repeated contractions that expel the underlying fat and increase the tonus at rest. The structural ageing becomes visible and with time, the expression of the subject is consequently more rigid.",

    "abstract": "This short review portrays the evolutionary theories of aging in the light of the existing discoveries from genomic and molecular genetic studies on aging and longevity. At the outset, an historical background for the development of the evolutionary theories of aging is presented through the works of August Weismann (programmed death and the germ plasm theories) including his exceptional theoretical postulation, later experimentally validated by the existence of cell division limits. Afterwards, the theory of mutation accumulation of Peter Medawar and the theory modification by Charlesworth (late-life mortality plateau) are presented as well as the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of George Williams, and the disposable soma theory of Kirkwood and Holliday. These theories are discussed in the light of the different research studies, which include studies on insulin signaling and longevity, the possibility that nuclear factor kappa B may be a major mediator of aging, studies of anti-aging Sirtuins and studies on heat shock proteins and longevity and on gene sets as biomarkers of aging. Finally, the proposals for future research in biogerontology, such as studies on the control of protein synthesis, validation of biomarkers of aging, understanding the biochemistry of longevity and research in the field of gerontologic pathology are presented. Likewise, further attention is suggested regarding the work on telomere shortening, stem cells and studies on understanding the biochemical and molecular basis for longevity in centenarians.",

This might best be described as an \"Electroplasmic Cycle.\" This is certainly applicable to dopaminergic neurons with their exceptional metabolic, electrical and rhythmic properties. Here I review normal aging of dopamine systems to highlight them as a valuable model. I then examine the possible integration of free radical and ion channel theories of aging.

    "abstract": "The afferent nerves of the cornea and conjunctiva, efferent nerves of the lacrimal gland, and the lacrimal gland are a functional unit that works cooperatively to produce the aqueous component of tears. A decrease in the lacrimal gland secretory function can lead to dry eye disease. Because aging is a risk factor for dry eye disease, study of the changes in the function of the lacrimal gland functional unit with age is important for developing treatments to prevent dry eye disease. No one mechanism is known to induce the changes that occur with aging, although multiple different mechanisms have been associated with aging. These fall into two theoretical categories: programmed theories of aging (immunological, genetic, apoptotic, and neuroendocrine) and error theories of aging (protein alteration, somatic mutation, etc). Lacrimal glands undergo structural and functional alteration with increasing age. In mouse models of aging, it has been shown that neural stimulation of protein secretion is an early target of aging, accompanied by an increase in mast cells and lipofuscin accumulation. Hyperglycemia and increased lymphocytic infiltration can contribute to this loss of function at older ages. These findings suggest that an increase in oxidative stress may play a role in the loss of lacrimal gland function with age. For the afferent and efferent neural components of the lacrimal gland functional unit, immune or inflammatory mediated decrease in nerve function could contribute to loss of lacrimal gland secretion with age. More research in this area is critically needed.",

    "title": "[Review of the approach to exercise behavior modification from the viewpoint of preventive medicine].",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to summarize the approaches to behavior modification for exercise from the viewpoint of preventive medicine. Articles were searched according to the particular field of preventive medicine, i.e., primary prevention, secondary prevention, tertiary prevention, and other fields of prevention. In the field of primary prevention for elderly people living at home, many fall prevention programs were found to have been carried out. In these studies, various programs were found to be effective if the exercise proved to be sufficient. Although some approaches were observed to be based on the productive aging theory and social capital, the number of such studies was small. In the field of secondary prevention, illness and functional disorders are prevented from becoming worse. It is therefore important for each individual to exercise by himself/herself and also acquire sufficient self-monitoring skills. Social capital is useful for learning good exercise habits. In the field of tertiary prevention, although exercise therapy is effective for improving physical functions and preventing disease recurrence in patients with chronic disease, some patients nevertheless find it difficult to continue such an exercise therapy. The approaches to behavior modification were extremely effective for patients with chronic disease. In other fields of preventive medicine, daily exercises such stair climbing are effective methods for reducing the risk of chronic disease and such a behavior modification may lead to a considerable public health gain. In the future, further studies with a many lines of evidence should be performed, and approaches based on behavioral science should be established.",

    "title": "Aging, evolvability, and the individual benefit requirement; medical implications of aging theory controversies.",
    "abstract": "There is a class of theories of aging (variously termed adaptive aging, aging by design, aging selected for its own sake, or programmed death theories) that hold that an organism design that limits life span conveys benefits and was selected specifically because it limits life span. These theories have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity because of the discovery of genes that promote aging in various organisms. However, traditional evolution theory has a core tenet that excludes the possibility of evolving and retaining an individually adverse organism design, i.e. a design characteristic that reduces the ability of individual organisms to survive or reproduce without any compensating individual benefit. Various theories of aging dating from the 1950s and based on traditional evolution theory enjoy substantial popularity. Therefore, any theorist proposing an adaptive theory of aging must necessarily also propose some adjustment to traditional evolution theory that specifically addresses the individual benefit issue. This paper describes an adaptive theory of aging and describes how one of the proposed adjustments (evolvability theory) supports adaptive aging. This issue is important because adaptive theories are generally more optimistic regarding prospects for medical intervention in the aging process and also suggest different approaches in achieving such intervention.",

    "abstract": "Perennial social insects are characterized by the extraordinarily long lifespan of their reproductive females, which may be tens or hundreds of times larger than that of non-social insects of similar body size and also greatly surpasses that of conspecific non-reproductives. Evolutionary theories of aging explain this phenomenon from the low extrinsic mortality queens experience once they have successfully established their colony. The aim of our review is to summarize recent findings on the ultimate and proximate causes of increased queen longevity in social insects, in particular ants and honey bees. While progress is being made in elucidating the interrelations between the vitellogenin, juvenile hormone, fecundity, and senescence, we feel that the explanation for the comparatively short lifespan of queens in multi-queen societies is as yet not satisfactory and needs further attention, both concerning its proximate and ultimate basis.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a process whereby organisms lose to the capacity to effectively handle life's stresses. Associated with aging are pathophysiological processes, such as decreases in bone mass, which in the extreme form lead to significant morbidity. Evolutionary theory suggests that these pathophysiological processes are permitted to occur because an organism need only preserve its body against stress only for the amount of time needed for effective reproduction. In this review, an understanding of osteoporosis and bone loss is discussed within the context of aging theory. Specific topics covered include: (1) bone loss as an antagonistically pleiotropic physiological process, (2) age-associated stress accumulation and its negative impact on bone turnover, and (3) the mechanisms whereby gonadal failure, increases in inflammatory cytokines, and cellular bone marrow changes lead to bone loss. This review concludes by examining purported hypotheses in the context of Werner's syndrome, a disease characterized by premature aging. We suggest that future osteoporosis therapy will likely focus on prevention of aging in general as a means to prevent the development of osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "The aging process results in a gradual and progressive structural deterioration of biomolecular and cellular compartments and is associated with many pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and liver dysfunction. Concomitantly, each of these conditions is associated with progressive functional decline, loss of independence, and ultimately disability. Because disabled individuals require care in outpatient or home care settings, and in light of the social, emotional, and fiscal burden associated with caring for an ever-increasing elderly population, research in geriatric medicine has recently focused on the biological mechanisms that are involved in the progression towards functional decline and disability to better design treatment and intervention strategies. Although not completely understood, the mechanisms underlying the aging process may partly involve inflammatory processes, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptotic tissue degeneration. These hypotheses are based on epidemiological evidence and data from animal models of aging, as well as interventional studies. Findings from these studies have identified possible strategies to decrease the incidence of age-related diseases and delay the aging process. For example, lifelong exercise is known to extend mean life-span, whereas calorie restriction (CR) increases both mean and maximum life-span in a variety of species. Optimal application of these intervention strategies in the elderly may positively affect health-related outcomes and possibly longevity. Therefore, the scope of this article is to (i) provide an interpretation of various theories of aging from a \"health-span\" perspective; (ii) describe interventional testing in animals (CR and exercise); and (iii) provide a translational interpretation of these data.",

    "abstract": "Aging is commonly defined as the accumulation of diverse deleterious changes occurring in cells and tissues with advancing age that are responsible for the increased risk of disease and death. The major theories of aging are all specific of a particular cause of aging, providing useful and important insights for the understanding of age-related physiological changes. However, a global view of them is needed when debating of a process which is still obscure in some of its aspects. In this context, the search for a single cause of aging has recently been replaced by the view of aging as an extremely complex, multifactorial process. Therefore, the different theories of aging should not be considered as mutually exclusive, but complementary of others in the explanation of some or all the features of the normal aging process. To date, no convincing evidence showing the administration of existing \"anti-aging\" remedies can slow aging or increase longevity in humans is available. Nevertheless, several studies on animal models have shown that aging rates and life expectancy can be modified. The present review provides an overlook of the most commonly accepted theories of aging, providing current evidence of those interventions aimed at modifying the aging process.",

Senescence is a complex process and the aging hypotheses concentrated on only one or very few elements of this process. The goal of the Unifying Theory of Aging is to organize these theories into an organic complex. Despite all our hopes aging is inevitable, the present information level of the human system allows only a temporary existence of an individual in time. During aging the system gradually drifts away from the developmentally differentiated state, which results in loosing step-by step the capability to cope with the deteriorating entropy force of the environment. Nevertheless, it is still possible to increase the mean life span of the human population but without altering the present information level of the human system aging still remains an incurable disease.",

    "abstract": "Free-living organisms normally struggle to exist in harsh environments that are nutritionally and energetically inadequate, where evolutionary adaptation is challenged by internal stresses within organisms and external stresses from the environment. The incorporation of environmental variables into aging theories such as the free-radical and metabolic rate/oxidative stress theories, is the basis of the ecological stress theory of aging and hormesis. Environmental variation from optimum to lethal extremes gives a fitness-stress continuum, where energetic efficiency, or fitness, is inversely related to stress level; in the evolutionary context survival is a more direct measure of fitness for assessing aging than is lifespan. On this continuum, the hormetic zone is in the optimum region, while aging emphasizes survival towards lethal extremes. At the limits of survival, a convergence of physiological and genetical processes is expected under accumulating stress from Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS. Limited ecologically-oriented studies imply that major genes are important towards limits of survival compared with the hormetic zone. Future investigations could usefully explore outlier populations physiologically and genetically, since there is the likelihood that genetic variability may be lower in those cohorts managing to survive to extremely advanced ages as found in highly stressed ecological outlier populations. If so, an evolutionary explanation of the mortality-rate decline typical of cohorts of the extremely old emerges. In summary, an energetic evolutionary approach produces a general aging theory which automatically incorporates hormesis, since the theory is based on a fitness-stress continuum covering the whole range of possible abiotic environments of natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria have been a central focus of several theories of aging as a result of their critical role in bioenergetics, oxidant production, and regulation of cell death. A decline in cardiac mitochondrial function coupled with the accumulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules may be causal to the decline in cardiac performance with age. In contrast, regular physical activity and lifelong caloric restriction can prevent oxidative stress, delay the onset of morbidity, increase life span, and reduce the risk of developing several pathological conditions. The health benefits of life long exercise and caloric restriction may be, at least partially, due to a reduction in the chronic amount of mitochondrial oxidant production. In addition, the available data suggest that chronic exercise may serve to enhance antioxidant enzyme activities, and augment certain repair/removal pathways, thereby reducing the amount of oxidative tissue damage. However, the characterization of age-related changes to cardiac mitochondria has been complicated by the fact that two distinct populations of mitochondria exist in the myocardium: subsarcolemmal mitochondria and interfibrillar mitochondria. Several studies now suggest the importance of studying both mitochondrial populations when attempting to elucidate the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to myocardial aging. The role that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play in contributing to cardiac aging will be discussed along with the use of lifelong exercise and calorie restriction as countermeasures to aging.",

Biological aging is considered to occur mainly during the period of survival beyond the natural or essential lifespan (ELS) in Darwinian terms. Organisms survive to achieve ELS by virtue of genetically determined longevity assuring maintenance and repair systems (MRS). Aging at the molecular level is characterized by the progressive accumulation of molecular damage caused by environmental and metabolically generated free radicals, by spontaneous errors in biochemical reactions, and by nutritional components. Damages in the MRS and other pathways lead to age-related failure of MRS, molecular heterogeneity, cellular dysfunctioning, reduced stress tolerance, diseases and ultimate death. A unified theory of biological aging in terms of failure of homeodynamics comprising of MRS, and involving genes, milieu and chance, is acquiring a definitive shape and wider acceptance. Such a theory also establishes the basis for testing and developing effective means of intervention, prevention and modulation of aging.",

These studies are considered in four groups: (1) Studies that address the free-radical theory of aging by analyzing candidate compounds with antioxidant activities including vitamin E, tocotrienols, coenzyme Q, and Eukarion-8/134. (2) Studies that analyze plant extracts (blueberry and Ginko biloba) that contain a mixture of compounds. (3) Studies of resveratrol, which was identified in a screen for compounds that affect the activity of the Sir2 protein that influences lifespan. (4) Studies based on screening compound libraries using C. elegans aging as a bioassay, which led to the identification of the anticonvulsant medicines ethosuximide and trimethadione. There has been exciting progress in the analysis of compounds that influence C. elegans aging, and important challenges and opportunities remain in determining the mechanisms of action of these compounds and the relevance of these observations to aging of other animals.",

    "title": "Aging is no longer an unsolved problem in biology.",
    "abstract": "For much of the 20th century, the accumulation of a considerable amount of information about the processes of aging did not reveal the underlying mechanisms. Toward the end of that century, the biological basis for aging became very much clearer. It became apparent that the best strategy for animals' survival was to develop to an adult, but not to invest resources in maintaining the body, or soma, indefinitely. In their natural environment, animals do not survive environmental hazards (predators, disease, starvation, and drought) to reach a long life span. There is thus a trade-off between the investment of resources in reproduction, and the survival time of the soma. At a stroke, this solves the problem of different rates of aging in different species, because those that develop and reproduce fast also have short life spans, and those that develop and reproduce slowly have long life spans. This difference is due to actual resources invested in the maintenance of the adult soma. There is now much evidence that long-lived mammals have much more efficient maintenance mechanisms than short-lived mammals. Thus, aging can be defined as the eventual failure of maintenance. It also became apparent that many different maintenance mechanisms exist, and that these depend on very many genes and a considerable investment in metabolic resources. Most individual theories of aging revolve around the failure of a given maintenance system, but as there are many of these, it is likely that most of the important theories have some degree of truth. A broad interpretation of the different degenerative changes during senescence should therefore be adopted, with the major conclusion that aging is multicausal. It is also evident that the evolved design of many components of complex animals is incompatible with indefinite survival. We can therefore conclude that this evolved design is intrinsically related to the fact of aging. This in turn means that aging cannot be reversed, although it may be modulated, as, for example, by calorie restriction.",

    "abstract": "Aging can be defined as a progressive decline in the ability of the organism to resist stress, damage, and disease. Although there are currently over 300 theories to explain the aging phenomenon, it is still not well understood why organisms age and why the aging process can vary so much in speed and quality from individual to individual. The oxidative stress hypothesis is one of the prevailing theories of aging. This theory states that free radicals produced during cellular respiration damage lipids, proteins, and DNA thereby accelerating the aging process and increasing disease risk. Under normal conditions, the electron transport chain is the primary producer of the superoxide anion, which is precursor to other highly reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical. Oxidative stress accumulates when prooxidants overwhelm the antioxidant defense mechanisms. This is dependent on a number of factors including free radical production, susceptibility of tissue to stress, and strength of the defense and repair system. Oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of chronic disease states usually grouped under the umbrella of the metabolic syndrome and is thought to contribute to the aging process. It has been hypothesized that the production of free radicals is dependent on resting metabolic rate and this may have an impact on the aging process. However, other factors, such as mitochondrial function, may be important in the production of free radicals and the subsequent effect on aging and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors play a relevant role in the attainment of longevity because they are involved in cell maintenance systems, including the immune system. In fact, longevity may be correlated with optimal functioning of clonotypic and natural immunity. The aging of the immune system, known as immunosenescence, is the consequence of the continuous attrition caused by chronic antigenic overload. The antigenic load results in the progressive generation of inflammatory responses involved in age-related diseases. Most of the parameters influencing immunosenescence appear to be under genetic control, and immunosenescence fits with the basic assumptions of evolutionary theories of aging, such as antagonistic pleiotropy. In fact, by neutralizing infectious agents the immune system plays a beneficial role until reproduction and parenting. However, by determining chronic inflammation, it can be detrimental later in life, a period largely unforeseen by evolution. In particular, the data coming from the long-lived male population under study show that genetic polymorphisms responsible for a low inflammatory response might result in an increased chance of long lifespan in an environment with a reduced pathogen burden. Such a modern and healthy environment also permits a lower grade of survivable atherogenic inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial theory of aging remains to date one of the most popular theories of aging. One major model of aging is replicative senescence, where the irreversible loss of division potential of somatic cells occurs after a more or less constant number of cell divisions. Few data are available concerning the role of mitochondria in this model. Here, we review evidence supporting the involvement of mitochondria in replicative senescence and a possible link to telomere biology. Moreover, we suggest that this process might be more complex than originally formulated, because variations in nuclear gene expression involved in mitochondrion nucleus cross-talk are observed in both senescence and immortalization.",

    "abstract": "Life-history theory generally predicts that there should be no selection for longevity beyond the limit of reproductive capacity. However, the capacity to increase fitness may not end when individuals reach a state of functional sterility. Recent studies show that intergenerational transfers of resources from post-reproductive parents can increase the offspring's fitness, and analytical theory shows that age-trajectories of transfers may shape the course of senescence in social organisms. In eusocial insects, female roles are partitioned so that one phenotype or \"caste\" reproduces while another is responsible for resource transfers: the reproductive \"queens\" are arrested in a continuous reproductive mode, while transfer-activities such as hygienic behaviors, guarding, foraging and further food processing (\"nursing\") that increases the nutritional value of provisions are conducted by sterile \"workers\". Worker honey bees normally perform these tasks in a sequence so that nursing inside the protected nest is conducted prior to more risky exterior hive activities such as guarding and foraging. However, foragers may revert to nurse-activity in response to demographic changes, and worker bees can also develop into a stress resistant survival form with a 10-fold increase in lifespan. This elastic division of parental functions is believed to increase colony fitness. Further, it generates a stage-dependent trajectory of senescence that is difficult to address with established theories of aging. In the following, we show how a recent theory that includes resource transfers can be used to elucidate patterns of senescence in eusocial, non-reproducing individuals like the honey bee worker.",

Many theories of aging predict causal roles for oxidative stress in the myriad of pathological changes that occur as a function of age, including an increasing propensity to develop cancer. A possible link between aging and cancer is the induction and accumulation of somatic mutations caused by oxidative stress. This Review focuses on small mutational events that are induced by oxidative stress and the role of mismatch repair (MMR) in preventing their formation. It also discusses a possible inhibitory effect of oxidative stress on MMR. We speculate that a synergistic interaction between oxidative damage to DNA and reduced MMR levels will, in part, account for an accumulation of small mutational events, and hence cancer, with aging.",

We describe the development of the general evolutionary theory, along with the mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and disposable soma versions of the evolutionary model. The review of the mechanistic theories focuses on the oxidative stress resistance, cellular signaling, and dietary control mechanisms of life span extension.

However, these studies collectively lack any examination of the element of sociality, an important feature of human biology. Social insects present a number of unique possibilities for investigating social influences on aging and potentially detecting new mechanisms for extremely prolonged, healthy life spans that have evolved naturally. Social evolution has led to life spans in reproductive females that are much longer (up to over 100-fold) than those of males or of nonreproductive worker castes. These differences are particularly dramatic because they are due to environmental influences, as all individuals develop from the same genomes. Social insect colonies consist of semi-autonomous individuals, and the relationship between the colony and the individual creates many interesting predictions in the light of the common theories of aging. Furthermore, the variety of lifestyles of social insects creates the potential for crucial comparative analyses across distinct social systems.",

    "abstract": "Several factors (the lengthening of the average and, to a lesser extent, of the maximum human life span; the increase in percentage of elderly in the population and in the proportion of the national expenditure utilized by the elderly) have stimulated and continue to expand the study of aging. Recently, the view of aging as an extremely complex multifactorial process has replaced the earlier search for a distinct cause such as a single gene or the decline of a key body system. This minireview keeps in mind the multiplicity of mechanisms regulating aging; examines them at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels; and explores the possibility of interactions at these three levels. The heterogeneity of the aging phenotype among individuals of the same species and differences in longevity among species underline the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors in shaping the life span. Thus, the presence of several trajectories of the life span, from incidence of disease and disability to absence of pathology and persistence of function, suggest that it is possible to experimentally (e.g., by calorie restriction) prolong functional plasticity and life span. In this minireview, several theories are identified only briefly; a few (evolutionary, gene regulation, cellular senescence, free radical, and neuro-endocrineimmuno theories) are discussed in more detail, at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels.",

Inefficient proteolysis might lead to the accumulation and ultimate deposition of potentially toxic entities as inclusions within neurons or glial cells. This hypothesis is supported by genetic evidence both from patient populations and from engineered mutations in genes that encode ubiquitin/proteasome components in mice. The appearance of similar inclusions in the brains of elderly individuals of normal and subclinical conditions begs the question of whether there is a general age-related decline in the ability of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (UPP) to recognize and eliminate abnormal proteins, and whether such a decline would be reflected by changes in the abundance or activity of some or all components of the UPP. Here we describe alterations in the aging mammalian brain that correlate with a decline in the function of the UPP and review the evidence for age-related changes in specific UPP components. These alterations are discussed within the context of prevalent theories of aging.",

In addition, the fact that the life span of growth-arrested Escherichia coli cells is greatly extended by limiting oxygen availability suggests that free radicals may be one causal factor behind bacterial senescence. Recent analysis reveals a novel culprit in this oxidation, namely the production of aberrant proteins, which are especially susceptible to oxidative attack. This route of oxidation appears to elude the classical oxidative defense proteins. In addition, the failure of growth-arrested cells to fully combat oxidative damage may be linked to a trade-off between proliferation activities and stress management. Even during stasis, E. coli cells maintain a basal transcription of reproduction-related genes, and resources are thus partly diverted from maintenance and stress defences to activities relating to proliferation. Thus, some aspects of bacterial senescence may lend support to contemporary theories of aging, including the free radical, antagonistic pleiotropy, and disposable soma theories.",

Nevertheless, although it has taken decades to convince ourselves that elderly people belong to a specific age group both biologically and medicinally, and in whom special criteria have to be taken into consideration, it seems that even they themselves do not present an homogenous group.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Today we often hear of authors of studies speaking of two subpopulation groups--one group that ages by all the laws of aging that we have encountered and accepted thus far, and the other group that seems to postpone aging due to 'programmed death', or more specifically due to low mastery/low emotional support or because of additional reasons; however, the existence of the two groups seems eminent.\n\nMETHODS: The identification of these two groups would allow us to find more realistic results in studies, and therefore a more efficient therapy for certain diseases.\n\nRESULTS: This hypothesis does not contradict the theories of aging that we have accepted (at least not the majority) and also does not contradict the fact that there is a large interindividual variability. This hypothesis doubts and claims there are exceptions to the initial assumption of geriatrists and gerontologists that 'parallel to the aging process, the functions of all organs and organ systems lessen.'\n\nCONCLUSION: The identification of these two groups would allow us to find more realistic results in studies, and therefore more efficient therapy for certain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Extensive studies of phenomena related to aging have produced many diverse findings, which require a general theoretical framework to be organized into a comprehensive body of knowledge. As demonstrated by the success of evolutionary theories of aging, quite general theoretical considerations can be very useful when applied to research on aging. In this theoretical study, we attempt to gain insight into aging by applying a general theory of systems failure known as reliability theory. Considerations of this theory lead to the following conclusions: (i) Redundancy is a concept of crucial importance for understanding aging, particularly the systemic nature of aging. Systems that are redundant in numbers of irreplaceable elements deteriorate (that is, age) over time, even if they are built of elements that do not themselves age. (ii) An apparent aging rate or expression of aging is higher for systems that have higher levels of redundancy. (iii) Redundancy exhaustion over the life course explains a number of observations about mortality, including mortality convergence at later life (when death rates are becoming relatively similar at advanced ages for different populations of the same species) as well as late-life mortality deceleration, leveling off, and mortality plateaus. (iv) Living organisms apparently contain a high load of initial damage from the early stages of development, and therefore their life span and aging patterns may be sensitive to early-life conditions that determine this initial damage load. Thus, the reliability theory provides a parsimonious explanation for many important aging-related phenomena and suggests a number of interesting testable predictions. We therefore suggest adding the reliability theory to the arsenal of methodological approaches applied to research on aging.",

    "abstract": "Stress targets energy carriers. Genes for stress resistance are selected that convey high metabolic efficiency enabling adaptation to the energetically restrictive and hence stressful environments of natural populations. Data from experimental organisms and from humans are consistent with a primary role for stress resistance underlying life span, which provides a hitherto neglected procedure for assaying longevity in natural populations. Taking into account the metabolic consequences of stressful environments, the free-radical theory of aging becomes a general stress theory of aging. A recent derivative, the deprivation-syndrome theory of aging, highlights resource and hence energy shortages. Energy balances under the stress theory of aging are primary for an understanding of the evolutionary limits of longevity of organisms in their habitats. In contrast, well-nourished humans of the modern era, and laboratory, domesticated and island populations are exposed to more benign conditions which appear to provide the background for other evolutionary theories of aging, especially the mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theories. In modern human populations where selection for stress resistance is relaxed compared with earlier harsher conditions, substantial future evolutionary extensions to maximum life span may be difficult to attain because of the mutation accumulation process. However there is an urgent need for comparative empirical studies of life-history traits including longevity under benign and harsh environments.",

    "abstract": "In humans, aging is inexorable. The progressive decrease in physiological capacity and the reduced ability to respond to environmental stresses lead to increased susceptibility and vulnerability to disease. Consequently, mortality due to all causes increases exponentially with aging. Attempts at understanding the causes of aging are limited by the complexity of the problem. Aging changes are manifest from the molecular to the organismic level; environmental factors affect experimental observations; secondary effects complicate elucidation of primary mechanisms; and precisely defined, easily measurable biomarkers are lacking. No one unifying theory may exist, since the mechanisms of aging could be quite distinct in different organisms, tissues, and cells. Evolutionary pressures have selected for successful reproduction, making it likely that the post-reproductive physiology of an organism (i.e., aging) is an epigenetic and pleiotropic manifestation of the optimization for early fitness. Indeed, antagonistic pleiotropy, wherein genes that enhance early survival and function but are disadvantageous later in life, may play an overriding role in aging. Theories of aging can be divided into two general categories: stochastic and developmental-genetic. These are not mutually exclusive, particularly when considering the free radical/mitochondrial DNA theory of aging. Increasing evidence suggests that cellular senescence and organismic aging are antagonistically pleiotropic manifestations of evolutionary pressures to prevent malignant transformation. In other words, aging may be the price we pay to avoid cancer. The beneficial paradox may be that the maximum lifespan potential of humans may have been achieved, in part, due to our ability to grow old.",

Each of them allow to explain plasibly some particular features of the aging process and pathologies associated with it. However, there are some phenomena related to aging and longevity that are not easily interpreted in frames of both theories; in particular, the increase of the life span of animals following caloric restriction, or beneficial effects of reactive oxygen species on multiple living functions, etc. On the other hand, the mostly unknown principles of theoretical biology suggested by E.S. Bauer in 1930s allow to explain from the monistic basis the essence of those and many other phenomena related to development, aging and longevity. The major postulates of the Bauer's theory and the corollaries of them are reviewed with the emphasis on the specifically biological phenomenon discovered by Bauer, the so called \"Basic Process\". The latter allows to find the means for the significant extension of the active life span. Taking Bauer's principles into consideration we contemplate the modern data on the peculiarities of free radical processes in living systems giving rise to electron excited species generation as the energy-informational foundation for the build up of an organism's resources for the counteraction of most pathological factors. The needfulness to employ these considerations for the resolution of the problems of gerontology is substantiated.",

I show how dynamic state variable models based on stochastic dynamic programming (Clark & Mangel, 2000) can be used to embed genetic theories of senescence (either mutation accumulation or antagonistic pleiotropy) in the somatic environment, as George Williams called for in 1957, and how they make the disposable soma theory of aging operational. Such models will allow unification of genetic and phenotypic theories of aging.",

    "abstract": "The Rate of Living and the Threshold Theories of Aging are two contradicting approaches used to explain experimental facts about aging in fruit flies. In this paper we suggest an approach that unifies these theories and removes the contradiction. The approach involves quantitative description of the oxidative stress theory of aging, which is presented in the form of a mathematical homeostatic model. The crucial variable in the model is called 'homeostatic capacity', which is analogous to the classical notion of vitality. We model the process of aging as the age-related accumulation of damage produced by oxidative stress, which reduces the homeostatic capacity of the organism. The model is tested with the experimental data obtained in the classical experiments by Maynard Smith in 1958-1963. Our homeostatic model explains the well-known results of these experiments more accurate than any one of the early theories of aging. We form an hypothesis about the mechanisms underlying the results observed in the experiments and analyze a possible interplay of these mechanisms. Our virtual replication of Maynard Smith's classical experiments demonstrates that mathematical modeling can be a powerful tool to reveal and investigate the inherent genetic and physiological processes underlying the data observed in complicated insect experiments.",

    "abstract": "The long life spans and slow aging rates of birds relative to mammals are paradoxical in view of birds' high metabolic rates, body temperatures and blood glucose levels, all of which are predicted to be liabilities by current biochemical theories of aging. Available avian life-table data show that most birds undergo rapid to slow \"gradual\" senescence. Some seabird species exhibit extremely slow age-related declines in both survival and reproductive output, and even increase reproductive success as they get older. Slow avian senescence is thought to be coupled evolutionarily with delayed maturity and low annual fecundity. Recent research in our lab and others supports the hypothesis that birds have special adaptations for preventing age-related tissue damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and advanced glycosylation endproducts, or AGEs, as well as an unusual capacity for neurogeneration in brain. Much of this work is in its early stages, however, and reliable biomarkers for comparing avian and mammalian aging need more thorough development.",

    "abstract": "Evolutional theories of aging and caloric restriction (CR) in animals predict the presence of neuroendocrine signals to divert the limited energy resources from energy-costly physiologic processes such as reproduction to those essential for survival in response to food shortage. The diversion of energy and subsequent molecular mechanisms might extend the lifespan. A growing body of evidence indicates that leptin, a peptide hormone secreted from adipocytes, has a key role in neuroendocrine adaptation against life-threatening stress such as fasting. The present review discusses the potential role of leptin in the anti-aging action of CR. Although several alternative signaling pathways might also mediate the anti-aging action of CR, leptin signaling could be a substantial pathway in the CR action. Research on neuroendocrine mechanisms of CR is warranted, because such efforts might provide clues to the regulation of the aging process in humans.",

The progress in theoretical gerontology provides the possibility to verify the theories in more exact way.

    "abstract": "Under an evolutionary perspective, antigens can be considered nothing else than chronic stressors that constituted the major selective pressure for immune system emergence and evolution. In this review, recent data are discussed under the hypothesis that human immunosenescence is the consequence of the continuous attrition caused by chronic antigenic overload/stress. The advantage of this theoretical approach is that a unifying hypothesis is proposed, which tries to fill in the current gap between the conceptualizations concerning the mechanisms which counteract aging and favor longevity in invertebrates and vertebrates. The hypothesis is that the immune system is, at a higher level of biological organization and complexity, the counterpart of the anti-stress response network identified in invertebrates as the major determinant of survival. We argue that some of the most important characteristics of immunosenescence, i.e. the accumulation and the clonal expansion of memory and effector T cells, the reduction/exhaustion of naive T cells, and the shrinkage of T cell repertoire, are compatible with this assumption. Thus, immunosenescence can be envisaged as a global reduction of the \"immunological space.\" Concomitantly, immunosenescence results in the progressive generation of cellular mosaicism which is the consequence of the heterogeneous replicative histories and telomere shortening of T and B cell subsets, as well as hemopoietic stem cells. Most of the parameters affected by immunosenescence appear to be under genetic control, and future research on biomarkers should address this point. On the whole, immunosenescence can be taken as a proof that the beneficial effects of the immune system, devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood, turn to be detrimental late in life, in a period largely not foreseen by evolution. This perspective fits with basic assumptions of evolutionary theories of aging, such as antagonistic pleiotropy.",

Here the state of this research area is presented separately in two parts: (1) activities and appreciation of biogerontology as a scientific discipline in Germany compared mainly to the USA, (2) recent developments in the scientific content and progress in the research of aging. As for Germany, except for some special items the fast growing importance of biogerontology is not reflected by research activities in this field, organization, social acknowledgement, and attraction for the younger generation of academics. Some reasons probably responsible for this critical situation are indicated. A rough sketch is made about the international publication activities in biogerontology following data of leading biomedical literature data banks. Main scientific, contents and trends are discussed. The stochastic damage theories of aging, mainly the dominating \"Free Radical Theory of Aging\" (40) or similar \"Oxidation Hypotheses of Aging\" (82)--commercially heavily supported by sellers of \"Antioxidants\"--are criticized from an evolutionary point of view. Such theories are not compatible with the evidence for the adaptive role of senescence as outlined recently (5). This evolutionary theory of aging and its application to an intensified research on the identification of the genetic program of regenerative syntheses and senescence in metazoic organisms offers a firm base for the future research on aging.",

    "abstract": "The underlying mechanism of calorie restriction (CR) extension of mammalian life spans operates by altering the rate of decline in reserve capacity (with time) as well as the exposure to growth stimulus, two mechanisms that seem to be related to the central genetically determined mechanism that controls mammalian life span over a 50-fold range. While genetic control is principally exerted at the level of metabolic rate and entrained protective defenses, CR appears to alter the rate of decline in reserve capacity and the exposure to growth stimulus without appreciable alteration of metabolic rate. CR accomplishes this by lowering the nutritionally driven level of insulin exposure, which in turn lowers overall growth factor exposure, improves age-declining maintenance of mitochondrial maximal function, and maintains a longer-term favorable balance of the insulin:growth hormone antagonism. Obtaining the 'halved' insulin exposure in calorie-restricted animals (relative to ad libitum fed) can be specifically targeted in non-obese ad libitum fed humans by multiple techniques, a situation that may confer most of the life span extension of CR without restricting calories. The prospect for even further extension of the human life span is considered.",

    "abstract": "There are several hypothalamic theories of aging, none of which has been validated. An approach to validation is to search for consequences of anatomic ablations of hypothalamic regions that are functional hallmarks of aging, or consequences of ablation that postpone the appearance of hallmarks of aging or extend longevity. Ablation of the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMN) in the weanling rat is associated with subsequent increased body fat, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, and decreased renal function. Each of these consequences is characteristic of aging in humans and in several animal models of aging. Ablation of the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) in the weanling rat leads to a symmetrically smaller animal with normal glucose and lipid metabolism, decreased body fat for size, and reduced risk of decreased renal function and circulating IGF-I levels. These are findings consistent with calorie restriction models in rodents that significantly extend life span. This review compares outcomes of lesions in the VMN, DMN, and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) for relevance to aging. To establish a relationship between these anatomic areas of the hypothalamus and aging, it is concluded that the VMN, DMN, and LHA lesions should be examined for impact on longevity and compared with data obtained from simultaneously studied intact ad-lib-fed and 40% calorie-restricted animals. Lesioned animals also should be rigorously studied for neurotransmitters (e.g., neuropeptide Y, beta-endorphin, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and galanin), and for behavioral changes consistent with aging, for accumulation of specific tissue lipofuscin and amyloid that are associated with normal aging and for other age-dependent findings, such as incidence of tumors and cataract.",

Numerous theories of aging exist, many of which postulate the existence of \"longevity genes.\" Recent advances in molecular biological and other techniques have allowed a significantly greater understanding of aging and age-related disease. This will be illustrated by four genetic and sporadic diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, transthyretin dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy-Icelandic type and scrapie related diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common of this group, is the leading cause of dementia in Western countries. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have shown the involvement of at least four genes in the pathogenesis of AD. In early-onset familial AD mutations in the beta PP, S182 (presenilin 1) and STM2 (presenilin 2 or E5-1) genes have been found, while in the more common late-onset AD the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 isotype is a major risk factor. Genetic studies have also helped to elucidate the etiology of rarer cerebral amyloidoses such as the recently described Hungarian amyloidosis that is characterized by meningocerebrovascular amyloid deposition, with resultant dementia. This disease is linked to a mutation in the transthyretin gene. It is hoped that in the near future this increase in knowledge will allow the development of therapeutic approaches to slow the aging process.",

In this review we have highlighted a number of bird species which are commercially available, easily maintained, and more thoroughly characterized with respect to basic physiology than many biogerontologists realize. There seem to us to be few intrinsic barriers to the development of several avian \"mice\"--extensively characterized species exhibiting exceptionally long life and retarded aging--and for these to become readily accessible as a laboratory resource for the gerontological research community.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of theories to explain the aging process have been proposed including: (1) stochastic (somatic mutation, error catastrophe, protein glycosylation); (2) developmental (immune and neuroendocrine); (3) programmed (genome-based); and (4) free radical. Although no single hypothesis fully explains all aging phenomena, the genome-based and free radical theories, in particular, are supported by significant observational and experimental evidence. In addition, these two proposals are related to each other in some respects, and possibly to other theories as well. Continued basic and clinical research in this highly complex and critically important area will add to our understanding and appreciation of the theoretical and practical implications of the aging process.",

Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of coordinated functions with a loss of complexity in all physiologic systems and a gradual decrease in the adaptability to the environment. A number of different theories of aging are briefly reviewed and pharmacologic intervention with, or rate control of the aging process is entertained. 2. Dementia is characterized by a progressive, non-specific disintegration of personality with cognitive decline. The distinctiveness of the disease process which underlies dementing illness from the aging process is emphasized. A number of different pharmacologic treatment modalities with a potential for interfering with cognitive decline and for providing disease control in dementing illness are considered. 3. Nootropics are defined as substances which facilitate integration through activation of physiologic adaptation. The possibility is entertained that nootropics through their particular action mechanisms might interfere with both the dementing process (i.e., disintegration of personality) and the aging process (i.e., loss of coordinated functions).",

    "title": "Radiation and aging: free radical damage, biological response and possible antioxidant intervention.",
    "abstract": "In this review, the basic processes responsible for radiation-induced changes in critical cell components and their biological consequences will be discussed. The chemical and physical alterations in biomolecules are mediated by free radicals and other reactive intermediates formed, following absorption of radiant energy, by ionization of proximal targets or the surrounding water molecules. Accumulation of free radical damage and its catalysis by various oxidants including quinones and other age pigments, metal ions, lipid peroxides, prostaglandins and components released from cells, increase with age. A cell's response to such damage depends upon environmental and inherited factors. DNA repair is an effective way to protect against radiation damage, but other constitutive or inducible defence mechanisms can also modify biological response, and these processes generally become less effective with age. Loss of fidelity with age of bio-feedback mechanisms including homeostasis, redox control, ion and metabolic regulation, which in turn affects cell growth and differentiation, energy efficiency, the immune system and general health, can be associated with free radical pathology. Current theories of aging will be examined including those involving wear-and-tear, genetic, metabolic, immunologic and biochemical factors. Ionizing radiation, as with other external stresses including UV, heat, chemotherapeutic agents, chemical carcinogens and tumor promoters, interact with nucleic acids, proteins and membrane phospholipids facilitating free radical-mediated oxidative damage. Appropriate antioxidant intervention, by inhibiting or reducing free radical toxicity, may offer protection against radiation, and alleviate or delay symptoms of aging and chronic disease.",

The data support the major hypothesis that age-related changes are generally caused by specific physiological factors that are extrinsic to cells. The success of these manipulations includes retarding or reversing specific age-related changes, and extending the life span. From another perspective, these findings have converted time in the analysis of senescence from an independent variable to a dependent variable. So far, we do not need to hypothesize any new mechanism that is not already known in disease or normal functioning.",

Knowledge of yeast mtDNA mutations and their functional effects, and of human mtDNA mutations identified in the mitochondrial cytopathies, provides for a concept of aging based on the cumulative effect of mutations affecting human mtDNA. An essential feature of this concept is heteroplasmy, representing mixtures of normal and mutant mtDNA at the cellular and mitochondrial level, resulting in a \"tissue mosaic\" of focal bioenergetic deficits. Direct evidence for the concept is provided by (i) focal loss of staining for mitochondrially encoded enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, in tissues of aged individuals (humans and rats) and (ii) an age-related increase in deletional mutations in mtDNA demonstrable by application of the polymerase chain reaction to DNA templates from individuals of different ages.",

    "title": "Biomarkers of aging in the neuroendocrine-immune domain. Time for a new theory of aging?",
    "abstract": "A common and generally accepted assumption is that with advancing age, the thymus undergoes progressive and irreversible involution. This is considered the main cause for the age-related deterioration of various immune functions and, ultimately, for the increased incidence of infectious, neoplastic, and automimmune diseases in old age. This assumption is no longer tenable because of several clear-cut demonstrations that age-related thymic involution is not an intrinsic and irreversible phenomenon. Various neuroendocrine or nutritional manipulations can to induce a regrowth of the thymus, even when applied in old age. This thymic reconstitution is followed by a consistent recovery of peripheral immune functions. These data strongly support the idea that thymic involution is a phenomenon secondary to age-related alterations in neuroendocrine-thymus interactions and that it is the disruption of such interactions in old age that is responsible for most of the age-associated dysfunctions. On the basis of this experimental and clinical evidence and as an alternative to purely immune or neuroendocrine theories of aging, a neuroendocrine-immune hypothesis is proposed. Further work is required to determine if the age-related disruption of neuroendocrine-immune interactions occurs because of progressive accumulation of stressor-dependent consequences at the level of one or the other system or if it may depend on a single common cause.",

Food restriction has its anti-aging action by reducing the intake of energy rather than a specific nutrient. Research findings on the possible mechanisms by which food restriction retards the aging processes are discussed. The use of food restriction to test theories of aging is described and the controversial issue of its possible use as an intervention of human aging is addressed.",

    "abstract": "The principles of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes which occur in biological cells considered as open systems, have been reviewed and applied in order to describe a possible evolution of cells during aging. The main feature of such an approach is that cells operating in a steady state, optimize their free energy production by lowering their entropy production which is kept to a minimum. Instabilities can however occur which can lead the cell from one steady state to another characterized by a lower production of entropy. Concomitantly, the level of errors or entropy of the system will increase. The process will continue and the cell will go from one state to another until a critical level is attained where the cell can not cope any more with keeping its organization and will die. The effect of stresses and mitosis have been also considered in this model. Such an approach stresses that cells can only subsist as a whole in certain states which are the result of the genetic constitution but also of the optimalization of cellular functions given their requirement in energy and the fluctuations from the environmental changes. In this respect, it reconciles both programmed and stochastic theories of aging.",

    "abstract": "There are two major theories of aging: the programmatic theory states that aging is an inherent genetic process, and the stochastic theory states that aging represents random environmental damage. Processes that are associated with cellular damage and aging are the production of free radicals (a process much enhanced after ultraviolet irradiation) and an increasing number of errors during DNA replication. Cellular manifestations of intrinsic aging include decreased life span of cells, decreased responsiveness of cells to growth signals, which may reflect loss of cellular receptors to growth factors, and increased responsiveness to growth inhibitors. All these findings are more pronounced in cells derived from photodamaged skin. Molecular manifestations of intrinsic aging, studied mainly in fibroblasts, are altered membrane composition, adhesion properties, production of extracellular matrix, and activity of the enzyme catalase. Molecular changes as a result of photoaging are less well characterized; published studies mainly target differences in composition of the extracellular dermal matrix.",

Several theories have been formulated to explain the aging process, ranging from immunological to free-radical theories of aging. Although the etiology of aging is important to understand, equally important is the differentiation of normal physiological changes from those associated with disease. The clinician's inability to recognize these differences may result in unnecessary testing, misdiagnoses and mismanagement of the elderly client. In addition, many of the changes associated with aging (e.g., decrease in visual acuity, impaired hearing) are potential hazards. One major role for the health care provider is to anticipate these changes, prepare the elderly client for them, and assist the elderly client in adapting to them. This article summarizes the physiological aspects of aging in the absence of disease and discusses some of the clinical implications related to these changes. Each system is addressed separately, as are the clinical implications related to that system.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the central nervous system have a long history; however, it is only recently that we have begun to understand brain function in health and disease states. And, the topic of the aging brain has become a subject of intense study for a short period. At present, the process of normal aging is relatively poorly understood. Although there are a number of theories of aging, no single theory appears to account for most age-dependent brain changes. This review provides a re-evaluation of the \"Calcium Hypothesis of Brain Aging\" in light of new evidence which supports the proposition that cellular mechanisms, which maintain the homeostasis of cytosol Ca2+ concentration, play a key role in brain aging; and that sustained changes in [Ca2+]i homeostasis provide the final common pathway for age-associated brain changes. This revision of the calcium hypothesis suggests that there is a complex interaction between the amount of [Ca2+]i perturbation and the duration of such deregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and it proposes that a small disturbance in Ca2+ homeostasis with a sustained increase in [Ca+]i over a long period has similar cell injuring consequences as that produced by a large increase in [Ca2+]i over a shorter period. Although there are several alternative mechanisms through which the regulation of cytosol [Ca2+]i can be disrupted (such as changes in ion channels, extrusion pumps, and sequestration), this review focuses on disruptions in energy metabolism and changes in the structure and function of membranes as the most likely antecedent events which lead to disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis. The principle purpose of this review is to identify scientific opportunities and stimulate further research into cellular mechanisms of brain aging.",

    "abstract": "In order to experimentally test the hypothesis that at the basal level senescence is caused by instabilities in DNA, techniques are required that allow the sensitive detection, quantification and characterization of DNA damage and DNA sequence changes in various organs and tissues of naturally aging mammals. In this article a strategy is presented that should allow the analysis of DNA damage metabolism in aging mammals from the original changes in the chemical structure of DNA (DNA damages) via their processing (DNA repair) to the molecular endpoints in terms of gene mutations and DNA rearrangements. With respect to the detection of DNA damage, a short overview is provided of recently emerged biochemical and immunochemical methods that can be applied immediately to study the spectrum of DNA damages in various organs and tissues of aging animals or humans. By contrast, before one is able to study low frequency changes in DNA sequence organization in somatic tissues, formidable problems have yet to be overcome. This is mainly due to the fact that the scale of highly advanced recombinant DNA techniques recently developed is almost totally devoted to the analysis of heritable genetic factors. In order to be able to study low frequency changes in DNA sequence organization in somatic tissues, we have initiated experimental approaches based on recently emerged shuttle vector technology in combination with transgenic mice, and on new electrophoretic separation principles. These approaches and their potentialities for testing somatic mutation theories of aging are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article attempts to briefly review the current status of knowledge of biogerontology as a basis for a beginning set of discussions on the potential roles of environmental agents in the modulation of rates of aging in man. The article has tried to summarize \"what the toxicologist should know about gerontology,\" whereas a companion review, by Dr. Jerry Williams, summarizes \"what the gerontologist should know about toxicity.\" The review begins by defining some basic terminology, including introduction of the term \"gerontogens\" for those putative environmental agents that may in fact modulate the times of onset and/or rates of development of specific aspects of the senescent phenotype. That phenotype is then briefly described from the level of populations to the level of molecules, including an organ systems approach with emphasis on what is observed in humans. Among the important points that emerge from this description are: the variety of phenotypic alterations; the multiplicity of phenotypic alterations in any one aged individual; the special vulnerability in humans of the arterial system; the loss of proliferative homeostasis; the decline in the efficiency of enzyme adaptation; the decline in protein synthesis; the increasing evidence of post-translational modifications of proteins and DNA; the evidence for chromosomal instability (and, therefore, the potential importance of environmental clastogens). Arguments for a genetic basis for differential rates of aging are then developed, and a number of \"genotropic\" theories of aging are tabulated (i.e., those theories that invoke crucial roles for alterations of the genomes of somatic cells, whether changes in gene expression, gene structure, or both). It is concluded that no single theory is supported by a preponderance of evidence. Because aging appears to involve numerous processes and is highly polygenic in its determination, it is likely that a number of different mechanisms are responsible for the phenotypic alterations and that different individuals exhibit various patterns of aging based upon their specific inheritance and environmental experiences. At this early stage in the development of experimental approaches to the study of environmental-genetic interactions in the genesis of different aspects of senescence, the most vital issue involves the question of suitable model systems. Clearly, a number of different model systems will be required. A selection of these is tabulated based upon their amenability to a reasonable degree of genetic definition and genetic manipulation. Only by controlling the genotype can the environmental influences be properly assessed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "title": "Genetics and aging; the Werner syndrome as a segmental progeroid syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The maximum lifespan potential is a constitutional feature of speciation and must be subject to polygenic controls acting both in the domain of development and in the domain of the maintenance of macromolecular integrity. The enormous genetic heterogeneity that characterizes our own species, the complexities of numerous nature-nurture interactions, and the quantitative and qualitative variations of the senescent phenotype that are observed suggest that precise patterns of aging in each of us may be unique. Patterns of aging may also differ sharply among species (for example, semelparous vs. multiparous mammals). Some potential common denominators, however, allow one to identify progeroid syndromes in man that could lead to the elucidation of important pathways of gene action. (The suffix \"-oid\" means \"like\"; it does not mean identity.) Unimodal progeroid syndromes (eg., familial dementia of the Alzheimer type, an autosomal dominant) can help us understand the pathogenesis of a particular aspect of the senescent phenotype of man. Segmental progeroid syndromes (eg. the Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive) may be relevant to multiple aspects of the senescent phenotype. Some results of research on the Werner syndrome may be interpreted as support for \"peripheral\" as opposed to \"central\" theories of aging; they are consistent with the view that gene action in the domain of development (adolescence, in this instance) can set the stage for patterns of aging in the adult; they point to the importance of mesenchymal cell populations in the pathogenesis of age-related disorders; finally, they underscore the role of chromosomal instability, especially in the pathogenesis of neoplasia.",

    "title": "Infectious diseases and aging: immunologic perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Four theories of aging provide a basis for understanding both the aging process and the primary alterations in host defenses that may occur with age. The immunologic theory of aging may be especially important in this regard, since immunologic defects may be responsible for many manifestations of aging, and a decline in immune function may also underlie the increased susceptibility of the aged to infection. However, multiple factors are probably responsible for the aging process and for changes in host defenses. Although several studies attempting to enhance the immune response of elderly persons and perhaps extend lifespan are in progress, no factor at present appears to be as important in this regard as three underutilized immunizations for influenza, pneumococcal infection, and tetanus.",

    "title": "Genotropic theories of aging: an overview.",
    "abstract": "We have considered a rather wide-ranging number of genotropic theories of aging, defined as those which specify genomic alterations as the key to the understanding of the mechanisms of senescence. The fifteen ideas we have discussed are listed in Table 1, which divides them, in a rather arbitrary fashion, into two broad classes--those which emphasize modifications in gene structure and those which emphasize modifications in gene expression. It seems probable that no single one of these ideas will emerge as \"the\" underlying mechanism of aging, but that many of them will prove to have some credence. The aging process most certainly is under highly polygenic controls. In the case of human beings, I have made crude estimates [33] based upon a analysis of the phenotypes of known or suspected alleles at 2,336 genetic loci and the assumption of an upper limit for man of 100,000 informational loci, that anywhere from about 70-7000 genes could in fact be involved. This should not discourage us from pursuing a search for those loci which may be of profound importance to human aging as it ordinarily occurs in most human beings. In my opinion, however, the most pressing short-term need for biomedical gerontologists is to discover biochemical genetic reasons to explain why certain individuals seem especially prone to one or another of the age-related debilities, such as cancer, the various forms of arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, senile cataracts and senile dementia. Therefore, in my view, the future of progress in geriatric medicine is likely to be closely coupled to progress in medical genetics and genetic pathology.",

    "title": "The neuroendocrine system and aging.",
    "abstract": "The course of aging in most endocrine glands is moderately well documented in man, but is somewhat less understood in the rat. With increasing age in man there is a significant decline in the secretion of hormones by the thyroid, adrenal cortex, testis and ovary; pituitary growth hormone falls but gonadotrophins rise. In man decline in the secretion of testicular and ovarian steroids appears to be due to primary age changes in the gonads, whereas in the rat age changes in the central regulatory mechanisms appear to be responsible for gonadal aging. Such findings have led to the formulation of a number of neuroendocrine theories of aging, which explain peripheral aging on the basis of an aging clock in the brain, primary age changes in neurotransmitter metabolism, age changes in the hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid, or in the regulatory actions of these glands.",

    "title": "Connective tissues--possible implications of the temporal changes for the aging process.",
    "abstract": "Two of the \"old\" mono-cause theories of aging have temporal changes in the connective tissues, especially those in collagen, as main events. The crosslinking of collagen is stable under physiological conditions shortly after the formation of fibrils and the additional physico-chemical stability attained later on probably does not influence the physiological functions of the tissues significantly. The temporal changes in collagen seen as increased thermal stability, decreased solubility and increased mechanical stiffness are discussed in relation to the underlying structural changes. It is concluded that the increased stability of the collagen (mainly type I) in the locomotive system and skin are not \"true\" aging phenomena. It is possible that the changes in the connective tissues of the lungs and kidneys contribute to the decrease of function with age. The \"normal\" increase of stiffness of type I collagen may contibute to the increased compliance and residual volume of the aging lung. Our present knowledge of the structure and function of collagens and ground substances in various basement membranes does not permit an evaluation of the role of connective tissues in the age changes in the alveolo--capillary complex, the glomeruli and the exchange between tissues and capillaries in general.",

    "abstract": "Two theories of aging are considered in this review. Although there exists substantial experimental evidence in support of the somatic mutation and error catastrophe hypotheses, several experiments have been published which are extremely difficult to reconcile with these models, at least in their simplest forms. These include the observation that biochemical and morphological degenerative changes observed in fibroblasts aged in vitro do not resemble alterations observed in cells obtained from aged donors, and the fact that tissues transplanted serially through different hosts do not decline in vigor in the manner predicted by the somatic mutation theory. Although biochemical and mutational alterations appear to accumulate in fibroblasts aged in vitro (in support of the error catastrophe model), there are substantial problems with the interpretation of such experiments, and some observations (such as the lack of increase in translational error in hemoglboin synthesis as a function of age) seem to argue directly against the error catastrophe theory. Some alternative theoretical and experimental possibilities are discussed, including the concept of programmed aging as the cause of senescence.",
